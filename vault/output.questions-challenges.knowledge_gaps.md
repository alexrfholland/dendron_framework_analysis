# KNOWLEDGE_GAPS: Knowledge gaps

## Sources and Questions

### UNESCOOCEAN24: Ocean decade vision 2030 – Challenge 10

**Question**: What priority datasets and instruments are needed to measure and track human–ocean values and behaviour change?

**Evidence**: “Success will also depend on the generation, sharing, and use of the following priority datasets: human-ocean connection/human-ocean values dataset(s)... a collaborative global, multi-dimensional ocean literacy survey tool (i.e., Ocean & Society Survey) to measure ocean connection and values...” (p. 7)

### EUCLIM24: Towards sustainable transformation: research priorities in climate change and biodiversity

**Question**: Which novel entities pose the greatest risks to human health and Earth-system stability, and what sustainable alternatives exist?

**Evidence**: 

> The effects of novel entities on the Earth system are largely unknown... Identifying which novel entities have the most significant impact and pose the greatest risks to human health and Earth system stability, constitutes a major research gap.
>

### IPBESTCA2: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 2. Visions of a sustainable world – for nature and people

**Question**: How do linguistic, geographic, and definitional biases limit the scope and inclusivity of more-than-human visions, and what research is needed to understand value orientations and transformative potential?

**Evidence**: “Linguistic and geographic biases: visions were primarily collected from sources available in English and to a lesser extent in Spanish and French… This gap resulted in a geographic bias that disproportionately favoured the inclusion of visions originating from Europe and North America.” “Bias in vision definitions: in assessing transformative change for positive futures, visions are currently defined with an emphasis on positive outcomes only, ignoring possible unintended consequences.” “There is a gap in the understanding of the relationships between the value orientation of visions and their transformative potential.” (2.6. Knowledge Gaps)

### EUECOSERVG2021: Ecosystem services accounting – part III

**Question**: What key ecological data gaps limit more-than-human accounting, and how can they be filled (e.g., cropland condition, soil formation rates)?

**Evidence**: “One of the major limitations of this study is the lack of data to model ecological condition for cropland. Cropland is a key ecosystem in the EU given its large extent… More data on the ecological condition of cropland would be needed to cover this large knowledge gap.” (Chapter 3.7)
“The assessment of the ES unmet demand is based on an average rate of soil formation, considered constant all over Europe. This is a huge assumption, since soil formation rates may vary according to temperature, precipitation and soil typology, among other factors. However, due to the lack of spatially explicit data on soil formation rates, it was not possible to obtain better estimates.” (Chapter 4.5)

### UNTRANS25: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 1. Transformative change and a sustainable world

**Question**: What are the key gaps in knowledge about transformative change and how can they be addressed to support a just and sustainable world?

**Evidence**: “During the assessment process seven categories of knowledge gaps were identified... Geographic and jurisdictional gaps... Knowledge gaps related to the needs of diverse actor groups... Knowledge gaps about historical cases... Linguistic knowledge gaps... gaps about the impacts of interventions... theoretical and conceptual gaps... gaps related to incompatibility across methods and scales.” (Section 1.5, Table 1.4)

### IPBESTCA4: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 4. Overcoming the challenges of achieving transformative change

**Question**: What are the key evidence gaps in understanding how domination/coloniality, institutions, consumption patterns, and emerging technologies impede or enable transformative change?

**Evidence**: “The literature that empirically demonstrates how the relations of domination that emerged and were propagated in colonial eras act as barriers to transformation… is relatively small and its geographic coverage is uneven.” (4.4)
“Much less attention is given to how [international financial and monetary] structures and institutions impede transformative change for nature and biodiversity.” (4.4)
“While there is a large body of literature assessing the impacts of human activities on biodiversity… there is much less information on how human lives and livelihoods are affected positively or negatively by actions toward transformative change.” (4.4)
“For emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and gene editing… there is limited evidence on how they can benefit and challenge transformative change for safeguarding biodiversity.” (4.4)

### IPBESPATHWAYS19: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 5. Realizing a sustainable world for nature and people: transformative strategies, actions and roles for all

**Question**: What actions simultaneously work for nature and people across contexts, and how do we understand accumulated effects, trade-offs, and synergies over time?

**Evidence**: 

> There are important methodological and data gaps in assessing the effectiveness and the potential social impacts of strategies, actions and instruments with transformative potential, as well as an insufficient understanding of the roles played by different actors and actor coalitions in it... There is a dearth of knowledge on what actions simultaneously work for nature and people, how they interact and jointly reverse trends of nature’s decline and social issues, under what social-ecological contexts and factor constellations and across which timescale.

### IBPESWILD22: Chapter 2: Conceptualizing the sustainable use of wild species

**Question**: How can we fill gaps in indicators that capture social-ecological linkages and socio-cultural benefits (including relational values) in sustainable use?

**Evidence**: “Yet there remain gaps around indicators that convey social-ecological linkages and socio-cultural benefits... Indicators that relate to indigenous peoples and local communities’ community rights and access are also poorly represented... Little monitoring combines indigenous and local knowledge with scientific monitoring methods.” (Executive Summary, point 11)

### EUHORIZON23: Horizon Europe strategic plan 2025–2027 analysis

**Question**: Key drivers of biodiversity loss and their impacts remain insufficiently understood to guide transformative, more-than-human governance.

**Evidence**: “R & I will be key to providing knowledge and methods for the protection and restoration of all ecosystems, habitats and species targeted by the proposal for an EU Nature Restoration Law, including knowledge about biodiversity status and trends. Drivers of biodiversity loss are far from being fully understood, as are their impacts. More knowledge and innovative approaches to tackle them are needed.” (Section 3.2.2 – Protect and restore our ecosystems.)

### IPBSVALUES22: Summary for policymakers of the methodological assessment of the diverse values and valuation of nature

**Question**: What key knowledge gaps limit embedding nature’s diverse values in decisions?

**Evidence**: “Specific knowledge gaps... include valuation approaches used by indigenous peoples and local communities; how inequalities among sociodemographic groups... affect value expression... and embedding robust valuation and its uptake in policy.” (D4; Table SPM 5)

### NZOCEAN21: The breaking wave: reforming the oceans management system in Aotearoa New Zealand

**Question**: Significant gaps in knowledge about marine ecosystems, species, and stock status impede effective more-than-human empowerment and protection.

**Evidence**: “There is an astonishing diversity of marine life in Aotearoa New Zealand. A lot is not known about ecosystems and how they operate. There are also thousands of marine species that have yet to be identified.” (Chapter 2.3)
“we simply do not know enough about the marine ecosystem, and our impacts on it, to manage it sustainably. It can be argued we will never know enough.” (Chapter 3.3)
“only 40 percent of fish stocks are ‘scientifically evaluated’, and only one percent are considered ‘virtually certain’ to be at or above the target level.” (Chapter 8.2)

---

### UNESCOAI23: Recommendation on the ethics of artificial intelligence

**Question**: How to ensure adequate AI, data, media, and information literacy for inclusive participation and oversight?

**Evidence**: 

> The development of AI technologies necessitates a commensurate increase in data, media and information literacy... public awareness and understanding of AI technologies and the value of data should be promoted through open and accessible education...
>
> *(Preamble; III.2 Principles – Awareness and literacy)*
