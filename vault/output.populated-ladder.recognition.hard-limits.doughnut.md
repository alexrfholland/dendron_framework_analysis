## Score 3: Core Conceptual Device / Implications Explored

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### EURIGHTS: Towards an EU Charter of the Fundamental Rights of Nature

- **Organisation**: EESC
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the study uses Doughnut Economics as a core conceptual device to frame nested rights and policy integration with SDGs and PBs, exploring implications for governance; however, detailed EU mechanisms specifically tied to Doughnut beyond conceptual integration are not fully specified.

- Explicit reference to nested model aligning with Doughnut’s safe and just space: 

> This establishes the basis for policies integrating Rights of Nature, Human rights and Economic rights... If the SDGs are incorporated in the model as well as planetary boundaries, we would ensure that human society develops in ways that ensure the integral functioning of the biosphere as well as making sure that nobody gets left behind.
>
> *(Section 5.3, p. 66)*


- Use of Raworth’s framing to articulate indicators/goals: 

> The Rights of Nature, with their pillars and in the integration of the essential content of fundamental rights, would guarantee the 'ecologically safe and socially just space', between social foundation and ecological ceiling.
>
> *(Section 6.4.2, Social issues (S1)*

, p. 103)

- Conceptual mapping and implications for outcomes and criteria: 

> The current sustainability model... represents a mechanistic worldview... The Rights of Nature hypothesis (three concentric circles) is therefore more accurate, as it represents a nested natural hierarchy of systems dependence - Nature, Human Society and Economy...
>
> *(Section 5.3, p. 64-65)*


- Diagrammatic integration supports governance implications: 

> Figure 12: Biosphere Model (Diagram by Azote Images, for Stockholm Resilience Centre).

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### EUCLIM24: Towards sustainable transformation: research priorities in climate change and biodiversity

- **Organisation**: EC
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the Doughnut is explicitly presented as an orienting model for thriving within ecological ceilings and social foundations, shaping research priorities and lenses (compass/checkpoint), with implications for policy and funding but without concrete policy designs laid out. - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> This report was also inspired by Kate Raworth’s internationally recogni sed Doughnut model... ‘The Doughnut consists of two concentric rings: a social foundation... and an ecological ceiling... Between these... lies a doughnut-shaped space that is both ecologically safe and socially just: a space in which humanity can thrive’.
>
> *(Introduction)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> This concept continues to be a compass and checkpoint for many nations and cities around the world seeking to implement their vision for humanity in the 21st century.
>
> *(Introduction)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> In sum, this collective report aims to promote transformative research... supporting research to address global challenges in climate and biodiversity.

## Score 2: Theoretical Treatment

### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### ROMEECO22: Transforming our economies from ego to eco

- **Organisation**: Club of Rome
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the paper explicitly discusses Doughnut Economics as part of the core reframing of economic concepts, but only conceptually and without concrete mechanisms for more-than-human empowerment.

- The author positions Doughnut Economics centrally within an emerging framework for transforming economics, yet remains at the level of conceptual synthesis: 

> It should continue what The Club of Rome’s Transformational Economics Commission has already started. That is, to connect some of the most important approaches to rethinking economics – including Doughnut Economics, Green Growth, De-Growth and Wellbeing Economics – into an emerging framework for transformational awareness-based systems change.
>
> *(p. 8–9)*


- The text links this to a shift from egosystem to ecosystem awareness, but does not provide specific policies that directly empower nonhumans: 

> But what the polycrisis of our time calls for is nothing less than a radical rethinking of these economic core categories around ecosystem awareness – that is, an awareness grounded in the wellbeing of the whole.
>
> *(p. 9)*


- The author includes a comparative table that gestures to commons-based ownership and wellbeing metrics but offers no detailed institutionalization that would operationalize Doughnut Economics toward nonhuman agency: 

> Wellbeing for all … Awareness-based collective action (ABC) … Commons-based ownership
>
> *(Table 1, p. 9)*

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### EIVIS23: Exploring new visions for a sustainable bioeconomy

- **Organisation**: JRC, EC
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because Doughnut Economics is explicitly referenced and used to frame the safe and just space and embedded economy ideas, but the source does not provide concrete, actionable implementation steps specific to doughnut governance. - Context/synthesis: Raworth’s embedded economy and the ‘good life within planetary boundaries’ are invoked as framing for the bioeconomy vision. 

> A similar hierarchy is presented and embraced across several disciplines... and wellbeing economy (e.g. the ‘Embedded Economy’ framing by Raworth (2017)).
>
> *(p. 9)*


- Context/synthesis: The destination of a ‘good life for all within planetary boundaries’ echoes Doughnut’s safe and just space, used to define the Green, Just and Sufficient Bioeconomy. 

> The underlying goal of the bioeconomy in this vision is to support ‘a good life for all within planetary boundaries’.
>
> *(p. 40)*


- Context/synthesis: The report suggests revising monitoring indicators and objectives consistent with this framing but does not detail doughnut-specific policy instruments. 

> We argue that the conceptual framework for the BMS would need to be revised... to capture a different vision for a green, just and sufficient bioeconomy.
>
> *(p. 41)*

#### IPBESTCA2: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 2. Visions of a sustainable world – for nature and people

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because Doughnut Economics is explicitly discussed, including a government implementation example (Amsterdam), but within this chapter it is presented descriptively without detailed operational mechanisms or explicit nonhuman empowerment beyond staying within ecological ceilings.

- The framework is described as a highlighted alternative economic vision blending social foundations with planetary ceilings: 

> Wellbeing for all within planetary boundaries... Goals include reducing inequality, enhancing social support and shifting the economic agenda away from continuous growth, while offering dignity for humans and other-than-human beings, including ecosystems and biodiversity.
>
> *(Table 2.1)*


- It is also listed as a government initiative among case study types, indicating practical uptake: 

> Government Initiatives • Doughnut economics (Amsterdam) ...
>
> *(Table 2.3)*


- The chapter situates it in strategies to increase transformative potential by reducing resistance and enhancing comprehensiveness: 

> Visions which deal with more drivers of biodiversity loss and nature’s decline, can be more impactful... The importance of comprehensiveness and support of consequential decision makers suggests options for advancing existing and newly developed visions...
>
> *(Executive Summary point 6; 2.3.2.1)*


- Prevents higher score: no concrete steps, indicators, or institutional designs for Doughnut implementation are provided in this chapter.

#### EUSTI50: S&T&I for 2050: science, technology and innovation for ecosystem performance – accelerating sustainability transitions

- **Organisation**: EC DG R&I
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report uses the doughnut framing within planetary boundaries to motivate identifying social/ecological arenas for intervention, but does not present applied governance/empowerment steps for nonhumans under this framework.

- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> The notion of the planetary and human health, especially the EcoHealth concept, could also be placed in this group... notions like the 'Doughnut Economy' within the planetary boundaries concept allow identification of critical social/ecological arenas.
>
> *(2.2 Co‑shaping socio‑ecological systems)*


- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Another key aspect is the focus on social change (social tipping points) as more impactful than (incremental) technical change.
>
> *(2.2 Co‑shaping socio‑ecological systems)*

#### TNBEYOND24: Analysing the beyond growth debate

- **Organisation**: TNO Publiek
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report provides an in-depth conceptual and applied review of Doughnut Economics, including policy impact chains and implementation questions, but as an evidence review rather than as a core guiding framework for action by the authors themselves.

- The report lays out the Doughnut concept, governance implications, and policy chain elements: 

> According to Raworth (2017), we currently fall short on fulfilling the basic needs of all people, while at the same time we are overshooting ecological boundaries... The summarised policy impact chain of doughnut economics can be found in Table a.4... Raworth (2017) gives several policy examples... she does not aim to provide a complete and prescriptive policy framework.
>
> *(A.4.2; A.4.4)*


- It explores implications for outcomes and indicators (non-GDP measures; social and ecological limits): 

> GDP is subordinate to social and ecological needs in the Doughnut Economy... economic welfare is assessed by the proportion... beneath the international poverty line...
>
> *(A.4.3)*


- It interrogates consequences and open questions for practice, highlighting the need for further research and implementation design: 

> More specific questions for further research include: what specific policies would be necessary for transiting to a doughnut economy and how would they be implemented... What outputs and outcomes are these policies expected to have?
>
> *(A.4.5)*

#### IPBESPATHWAYS19: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 5. Realizing a sustainable world for nature and people: transformative strategies, actions and roles for all

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because Doughnut Economics is explicitly cited under alternative economic visions (as part of Wellbeing within Planetary Boundaries) informing metrics and goals, but the chapter does not lay out concrete, enforceable mechanisms for doughnut-based governance.

- The text lists doughnut economy as part of an emergent paradigm: 

> Wellbeing within Planetary Boundaries (including proposals for an economy of the common good, doughnut economy and buen vivir) (Annex 5.4).
>
> *(5.5)*


- It connects to replacement/adjustment of GDP and new measures aligning with broader goals: 

> Alternative measures integrating other economic, social (including cultural) and environmental dimensions are available to measure progress. These measures either adjust... replace it... or supplement it to account for nature’s contributions...
>
> *(5.5.4)*

#### EUTRANS24: Mapping ERC frontier research: addressing climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution

- **Organisation**: ERC
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because Doughnut Economics is explicitly referenced as a guiding alternative within the legal/economic redesign (N‑EXTLAW) and supporting materials, but the report primarily maps projects rather than developing Doughnut-based policies, leaving it as a prominent framing rather than an operational governance mechanism.

- Context/synthesis: The report identifies doughnut economics among alternative models informing legal changes for non-extractive, sustainable economic practices. 

> Bartl highlights the relentless focus on profit extraction... alternative economic models, such as doughnut economics or postgrowth, have only gained modest political traction, and the scaling-up of these models meets difficulties...
>
> *(4.1)*


- Context/synthesis: It references guidance linking post-growth, degrowth, the doughnut and circular economy, situating this framework within transformation discourses. 

> Federico Savini, Post-growth, degrowth, the doughnut and circular economy: a short guide...
>
> *(End notes 43; 4.1 cross-references)*

### SCENARIOS AND FUTURES EXPLORATION

#### NESTORIES24: Mapping and analysis of alternative growth paradigms: towards a taxonomy and storylines

- **Organisation**: MultiFutures/TNO
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because Doughnut Economics is one of the primary paradigms integrated in the taxonomy and storylines, with explicit references to double boundaries and policy implications.

- Context/synthesis: Doughnut is in the selected set and feature-extracted as a paradigm in the taxonomy and analysis: “Doughnut Economy... were seen as equivalents. Hence merged into one paradigm, under the heading ‘Doughnut economy’.” (p.23)

- Context/synthesis: It presents boundary-based goals and instruments in Post-Growth/Great Mindshift storylines, aligning with Doughnut logic: “Environmental goals are likely to be based on intensified efforts towards staying within all planetary boundaries rather than to reach climate change targets only.” (p.46)

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### SCTRANSS25: Environment strategy for Scotland – transformative changes for sustainability

- **Organisation**: Scottish Government
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because Doughnut Economics is discussed as a referenced framework within a broader post-growth discourse, but it is not the core guiding mechanism and is not operationalised with specific Scottish policy steps in this report.

- The report situates Doughnut alongside planetary boundaries and alternative measures of wellbeing without detailing a tailored implementation package: 

> Wealth – material or otherwise... is dependent on all life flourishing... Damage to life and rising inequalities are the result of accumulation driven by dominant notions of progress... (Moore, 2015; Jackson, 2009; Raworth, 2017).
>
> *(2. Global policy and science-policy discourse)*


- It frames Doughnut-type approaches as part of the needed shift in goals and values, but concrete policy design relies on the broader post-growth toolkit: 

> There is a clear need to change how we organise economies, including underlying principles, values and structures.
>
> *(5. Systemic constraints of reform-oriented approaches)*


- The report emphasises deep leverage and values/paradigm shifts in line with Doughnut thinking, but then operationalises via other instruments (taxes, ownership, procurement, commoning), not a specific Doughnut blueprint: 

> Deep leverage points... require more than national government policy levers... the nature of the state and... politics and economies... specific policy levers which can contribute... economic and financial measures... legal pathways... socio-cultural approaches...
>
> *(Executive Summary; Table 3)*

### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### EUANTHRO: Exiting the Anthropocene? Exploring fundamental change in our relationship with nature

- **Organisation**: EEA
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because the Doughnut is mentioned among alternative metrics/economic models without substantive development or policy detail in this briefing.

- Context/synthesis: The text references the Doughnut model when discussing alternatives to GDP and boundary-constrained economies, but without elaboration (citations to Raworth, 2017) (p.5).

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### EUONEHEALTH24: One Health governance in the European Union

- **Organisation**: SAPEA
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because Doughnut Economics is cited as a reference in the economic considerations to highlight tensions between growth and planetary limits, but it is not developed or operationalised in the report.

- The report references Doughnut Economics to situate One Health’s economic critique in relation to planetary limits: 

> However, economic growth is often at odds with healthy ecosystems (Almassi, 2018; Asdal et al, 2023; Raworth, 2017; Stuart, Gunderson, & Petersen, 2020).
>
> *(One Health definition – Economic considerations)*


- The mention supports conceptual framing rather than implementation guidance: 

> To ignore the risk of a failing planetary ecosystem and focus only on other health and wellbeing considerations is short-sighted.
>
> *(One Health definition – Economic considerations)*
