# NATURE_DISCONNECT: Nature disconnection

## Sources and Questions

### UNESCOOCEAN24: Ocean decade vision 2030 – Challenge 10

**Question**: How to restore societal emotional and cultural connections with the ocean to motivate behaviour change?

**Evidence**: “Behaviour change requires personal, emotional, and cultural connections with the ocean. Community engaged science is essential. People need to see themselves as being part of the solutions.” (p. 9)

### UNCITIES21: Global environment outlook for cities – towards green and just cities (GEO for Cities)

**Question**: How can cities address the ‘extinction of experience’ and declining environmental literacy to support multispecies inclusion?

**Evidence**: “Further declines in biodiversity could also result in urban dwellers having less contact with nature, a decrease in environmental literacy and an ‘extinction of experience’, with the potential for negative impacts on health and well-being (Louv 2008; Soga and Gaston 2016).” (Chapter 3, 3.5)
“This may result in a desire for people to reconnect with nature... However, it may also allow for new experiences of nature in cities as ‘novel ecosystems’.” (Chapter 3, 3.5)

### UNLAND17_2: The Global Land Outlook: Part 2 - The Outlook

**Question**: How can urban planning reduce the disconnection of urban populations from rural production and ecosystem processes?

**Evidence**: 

> Urban expansion is mainly taking place in peri‑urban areas, slowly fragmenting and occupying agricultural and natural landscapes... Urban populations are increasingly disconnected from rural areas and the ways in which food and other land‑based goods are produced.
>
> *(Chapter 6/11, Urbanization; Urbanization)*

### UNLAND17_1: The Global Land Outlook: Part 1 - The Big Picture

**Question**: How can societies rebuild relational connections with land amidst rapid urbanization and environmental degradation?

**Evidence**: 

> We are losing our connection with the earth. We are losing far too quickly the water, soil, and biodiversity that support all life.
>
> *(Foreword, p. 7)*

> Being in direct contact with the land can lead to both mental and physical health benefits; it can also reinforce who and where we are, giving us a sense of self and place.
>
> *(Chapter 1, Meaning of Land, p. 24)*

### UNPLANETBOUND22: Thematic study: planetary boundaries

**Question**: How do we transform our flawed relationship with nature that treats it as a resource for humans rather than an indispensable ally in risk reduction?

**Evidence**: “Our flawed relationship with nature stems from the way we view nature, as a source of goods and services to be exploited... All the more reason why we must urgently transform our flawed relationship with nature and view and value nature as an indispensable ally in collective efforts to reduce risk and build resilience.” (Part 1.3)

### UNLANDETHICS: Concept note of the World Commission on the Ethics of Scientific Knowledge and Technology (COMEST) on land-use ethics

**Question**: How can policy reverse land degradation and biodiversity loss while restoring more-than-human communities?

**Evidence**: “The devastating impacts of these and other land-use change on biodiversity have been recently documented... The Yellowstone example is demonstrating how reintroduction of a so-called ‘keystone’ predator can initiate the restructuring and recovery of a complex degraded ecosystem.” (I.2 Biodiversity; II.3.1)

### UNESCOEDU20: Learning to become with the world: education for future survival

**Question**: How can education shift from learning about a separate ‘world out there’ to situated practices of learning with the world and its more-than-human communities?

**Evidence**: “The new charter... has required us to challenge education’s most fundamental binary – the ‘subject/object’ divide... We now proceed with an ecological consciousness that firmly repositions all humans as ecological insiders... possibilities for collaborative and collective more-than-human learning with the world.” (Visionary declarations, 5)
