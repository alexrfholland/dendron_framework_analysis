# POWER_DYNAMICS: Power dynamics

## Sources and Questions

### UNLAND17_3: The Global Land Outlook: Part 3 - A More Secure Future

**Question**: How can power asymmetries in global value chains—especially between large buyers/retailers and small producers—be addressed to reduce land system pressures and enable fair, sustainable practices?

**Evidence**: “Most value chains are demand-driven, with major supermarkets as the chief buyers and large traders acting as intermediaries… The power imbalance between buyers and producers is distorting markets and squeezing small farmers out of business.” (Part Three – Response 5: Global value chains)
“Public policies to address this imbalance can include financial mechanisms that incentivize sustainable agriculture; laws to ensure fair deals between supermarkets and small farmers; and policies to help farmers overcome market failures that prevent them from accessing more distant markets.” (Part Three – Response 5: Global value chains)

### UNCITIES21: Global environment outlook for cities – towards green and just cities (GEO for Cities)

**Question**: How can cities prevent ‘green gentrification’ and displacement when implementing nature-based or sustainability projects?

**Evidence**: “Similarly, improvements to local air quality and the installation of energy-efficient housing in certain neighbourhoods can have a perverse effect on urban wealth divisions as they can lead to increases in real estate prices. This is what some researchers have called ‘green gentrification’... environmental projects are contributing to the displacement of low-income – and often racialized – communities.” (Chapter 2, 2.2.2)
“Planning for gentrification effects before displacement happens... a ‘just green enough’ approach can uncouple environmental regeneration and clean-up from high-end residential and commercial development.” (Chapter 5, 5.5.1)

### SCTRANSS25: Environment strategy for Scotland – transformative changes for sustainability

**Question**: How can transformative change confront intensifying corporate power, lobbying, and the political economy that constrain post-growth, care-oriented transformations?

**Evidence**: “The notion that the corporate private sector should be at the table lacks critical reflection... It under-estimates the intensifying power and wealth of multi-national corporations and elite individuals... business representatives even taking positions of power... This obscures the role of corporate power in preventing transformative change.” (4. Challenges in Transformative Change Theory)

---

### EUCLIM24: Towards sustainable transformation: research priorities in climate change and biodiversity

**Question**: How do justice, power asymmetries, and recognition shape equitable governance outcomes across climate and biodiversity?

**Evidence**: 

> Justice discussions have proliferated... components of justice that require consideration have been defined as: distributive, epistemic, restorative, procedural, and recognition... questions remain around how just and equitable decision-making structures, processes and outcomes are currently.
>
> *(Section 4.1)*



---

### TWITRANS18: Transformations to achieve the sustainable development goals

**Question**: How to address vested interests, elite resistance, and political capture that impede sustainability transformations?

**Evidence**: “We identify five major types of resistance… The first is vested interests… owners of fossil fuels… beneficiaries of unsustainable land and ocean practices… The second comes from elite groups more generally… resistant to the taxation needed… The fourth is the difficulty of a suitable balance in public-private partnerships… regulatory agencies can be captured…” (Points of resistance to sustainable development)
“Transformational change is needed but to succeed we must take along winners and losers… Understanding and analyzing the potential impacts, synergies and tradeoffs… will be essential.” (Key Messages #5)

---

### STOCK50: Stockholm+50: unlocking a better future

**Question**: How can unequal power relations and conflicts of interest be addressed to support equitable transitions and avoid backlash?

**Evidence**:  

> With more actors... conflicts of interest and uneven power relationships must also be recognized... The gap in trust and solidarity between countries acts as a barrier...
>
> *(Improving conditions for change)*



---

### UNLAND17_2: The Global Land Outlook: Part 2 - The Outlook

**Question**: How can policies address land grabs and unequal power in food/fuel trade that degrade ecosystems and reduce rural livelihoods?

**Evidence**: 

> ‘Land grabs’ are a growing phenomenon... The term refers to the acquisition, by outside interests, of the rights to harvest timber or establish large-scale commercial farms, plantations, or livestock operations often on lands where tenure has historically been communal or customary... Concern is mounting about the impacts of these large-scale acquisitions on food security, hydrology, land use change, including deforestation, and losses in rural employment opportunities.
>
> *(Chapter 7, Land grabbing and virtual land trading)*



---

### UNLAND17_1: The Global Land Outlook: Part 1 - The Big Picture

**Question**: How can governance address power imbalances and land grabs that dispossess communities and degrade ecosystems?

**Evidence**: 

> Such events frequently result in dire consequences for traditional land users, whose lands are often expropriated without consent or compensation, leaving them alienated from their community and their property.
>
> *(Chapter 1, Meaning of Land, p. 23)*

> Land grabs are often either illegal… or irregular… However, completely legal land grabs can exhibit many of the same problems… Almost half the existing land deals analyzed involved land formerly owned by communities, pushing people into cities, marginal areas, or remaining natural forests.
>
> *(Chapter 5, Land Resources and Human Security, pp. 83–84)*



---

### EIVIS23: Exploring new visions for a sustainable bioeconomy

**Question**: How can policies confront colonial histories and neocolonial patterns in bioeconomy supply chains and governance?

**Evidence**: “The responsibility of the EU to promote globally just bioeconomy relates to its colonial history and neocolonial tendencies that drive global inequalities, various forms of extraction and domination, biodiversity loss and climate change... global trade... disproportionately benefit and burden different parts of the world... a division which tends to follow historical colonial lines.” (p. 28-29)

---

### IPBESTCA3: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 3. How transformative change occurs

**Question**: How to navigate tensions and power struggles inherent in transformative change that challenges incumbents?

**Evidence**: “Transformative change entails trade-offs and tensions... Not everyone benefits... Transformative change may be contested by those afforded power in the status quo... The relative position of different worldviews, values and power relations... will influence the outcomes.” (Executive summary point 6, p. 106)

---

### IPBESTCA2: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 2. Visions of a sustainable world – for nature and people

**Question**: How do status quo interests resist comprehensive visions and what strategies can reduce resistance while maintaining transformative scope?

**Evidence**: “Resistance is assessed as the likely opposition of the status quo to the implementation of the vision… Together, resistance and comprehensiveness define the transformative potential of a vision.” “Creators of visions that already address views, structures and practices comprehensively can emphasize the role of power dynamics for these visions to become more achievable.” (2.3.2.1)

---

### DWILD20: Designing wildlife-inclusive cities

**Question**: How can projects balance function/safety demands (e.g., lighting) against wildlife needs without wildlife being consistently deprioritized?

**Evidence**: “Conflicts between function, safety and nature arose on some occasions and nature was then valued lower than other requirements (e.g. lighting).” (3.1)

---

### UNLEGAL: Environmental rule of law: tracking progress and charting future directions

**Question**: How can environmental rule of law deter organized environmental crime without resorting to excessive criminalization and militarization that harm vulnerable communities?

**Evidence**: “While criminalization of environmental offenses can be an important tool… there is a danger of over-criminalization… and military-style approaches to enforcement… Indiscriminate increases in criminal penalties… can result in disproportionate punishment of low-level offenders, often racial or ethnic minorities. Instead, a focus on targeting leaders of organized criminal groups… can create an important deterrent to environmental crime.” (Chapter 2, Sections 2.3.5 and 2.4)

---

### EUHRPLAN21: Human rights for the planet

**Question**: How should courts balance economic development and environmental protection under the margin of appreciation in a climate and biodiversity emergency?

**Evidence**: “The Court has afforded the same wide discretion to States whether the general aim they pursued, was environmental protection (including nature’s conservation) or economic well-being of a country... Both, economic growth and healthy environment constitute sustainable development goals.” (Balancing of interests – Overview of ECtHR environmental case-law)
“Could therefore human rights law require that States, in balancing these interests must be guided, among other factors, by the existing environmental and climate emergency?” (Balancing of interests – Overview of ECtHR environmental case-law)

---

### EUNATURERIGHTS21: Can nature get it right? Rights of Nature in the European context

**Question**: How to improve enforcement given conflicts of interest, administrative inertia, and the need for independent regulators and sanctions?

**Evidence**: “weak and uneven enforcement is the main challenge for EU environmental law of today... For effective enforcement... there must be well financed authorities with full competence to intervene... If the administration neglects to do its job, the public concerned must have the possibility to challenge this inaction in court.” (5.5 Enforcement)
“introducing rules... enabling the national courts to order the administration to perform according to instructions and report back... particularly interesting if combined with sanction possibilities... consider establishment of independent environmental regulatory authorities...” (6. Summary of Proposals, points 6–7)

---

### EUONEHEALTH24: One Health governance in the European Union

**Question**: How can EU governance address inequities and power imbalances among human health, veterinary, and environmental sectors to ensure equitable One Health implementation?

**Evidence**: “One Health operationalisation is hampered by significant inequity and power imbalances between different sectors. A high-level governance organisation or actor could ensure the equal distribution of data and resources, and advocate for equity between sectors as part of decision-making...” (Executive summary – Evidence-based options for policy and research gaps)

---

### TNBEYOND24: Analysing the beyond growth debate

**Question**: How to address entrenched economic and political interests that hinder post-growth and Doughnut-aligned transformations?

**Evidence**: “Green growth relies on the assumption that decoupling... can be achieved... While claims are made... no evidence exists of long-term and all-encompassing decoupling... Is there a role for further dedicated industrial policy... to speed up the transition?” (A.2.5)
“Degrowth... What would be the feasibility of such policy implementation?” (A.5.5)

---

### UNTRANS25: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 1. Transformative change and a sustainable world

**Question**: How can governance overcome concentrations of wealth and power and vested interests that mobilise against transformative change?

**Evidence**: “Despite calls for transformative change, powerful actors that benefit from the status quo are mobilizing resources to protect their vested interests... The concentration of power and wealth also creates differential access to decision-making processes... Individuals, corporations and other organizations that benefit from current systems often wield their power and resources to protect their interests.” (Sections 1.2.2 and 1.2.3)

---

### IPBESTCA4: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 4. Overcoming the challenges of achieving transformative change

**Question**: How do concentrations of wealth and corporate influence (‘keystone actors’) entrench biodiversity loss and obstruct transformative policy change?

**Evidence**: “Economic and political inequalities are a challenge to transformative change because they contribute to maintaining the status quo… Concentrated corporate and financial power also challenge efforts to achieve transformative change… what some scholars call ‘keystone actors’, equating the influence of transnational corporations over economic and environmental systems to the impact of keystone species.” (4.2.2)
“[Shareholder primacy] drives investment decisions toward shareholder interests and profit rather than the public interest… This becomes a barrier to transformative change when such change is viewed as a threat to owners of capital.” (4.2.2)

---

### IPBESPATHWAYS19: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 5. Realizing a sustainable world for nature and people: transformative strategies, actions and roles for all

**Question**: How do power imbalances and inequalities at different scales affect nature decline and equity, and what actions overcome entrenched power structures?

**Evidence**: 

> Power in economic and financial systems at different scales: There is a need to better understand how power imbalances and different types of inequalities affect directly and indirect nature decline and equity... There is a need for more clearly identified and strategically integrated actions to overcome power structures that maintain path-dependencies...
>
> *(Box 5.3)*



---

### CAGENE23: Framing challenges and opportunities for Canada – Expert panel on regulating gene-edited organisms for pest control

**Question**: How can Indigenous rights and consent be upheld when gene-edited organisms may disperse across lands?

**Evidence**: 

> Gene-edited organisms could spread into Indigenous communities’ local environments without their knowledge or consent, violating inherent rights or Treaty Rights... There are concerns… with consideration for human rights standards and fundamental freedoms.
>
> *(Chapter 1; Chapter 2.3)*



---

### IPBSVALUES22: Summary for policymakers of the methodological assessment of the diverse values and valuation of nature

**Question**: How do power asymmetries shape whose values of nature are recognized in decision-making?

**Evidence**: “Institutions... play a crucial role in shaping how nature is valued within and across societies... ensuring greater transparency about which values are embedded in institutions is key... Recognizing and respecting the world-views, values and traditional knowledge of indigenous peoples and local communities...” (KM7) “Only a small fraction of valuation studies... explicitly report on measures to account for power asymmetries within the valuation process itself.” (B6)

---

### IUCNBUILD25: Catalysing biodiversity on buildings: a review of supporting initiatives in European cities

**Question**: How to negotiate perceived competition between biodiversity space and affordable housing needs?

**Evidence**: “Perceived competition for space with affordable housing... Solutions to these challenges require the dedication of precious space and resources... measures examined in this report can support greater housing density and simultaneously increased biodiversity at the building scale.” (Conclusions)

---

### EUTRANS24: Mapping ERC frontier research: addressing climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution

**Question**: How to confront political economy conflicts (e.g., backlash, land-use trade-offs, extraction externalities) that stall or distort transitions?

**Evidence**:  

> Backlash can arise because of economic factors... cultural factors... or the complex ways in which policy expectations interact with peoples’ everyday lives... extreme forms of backlash are uncommon but... very impactful...
>
> *(2.1 Institutions and environmental governance)*

> The green transition is not meeting the challenge of radically rethinking how we structure our global economy but simply shifting to new manifestations of familiar forms of resource and labour extraction...
>
> *(3.1 Environmental and climate litigation)*



---

### GEAURBANGREEN23: Tackling the Climate and Biodiversity Crises in Europe through Urban Greening Plans

**Question**: How can biodiversity objectives be prioritised against competing land-use interests (housing, transport), and what policy levers can shift current political priorities?

**Evidence**: - Context/synthesis: The report recognises high competition over urban land and political priorities that disfavor green space, recommending strong policy prioritisation of nature and biodiversity. 

> No prioritisation of NbS in land use decisions as a result of competing interests and high competition over space in urban areas, and urban densification in favour of housing and infrastructure development;
>
> *(Annex II, Table 1)*


- Context/synthesis: It proposes adopting land degradation neutrality as a bottom line and revising planning instruments to privilege biodiversity. 

> UGP should ensure the prioritisation of nature and biodiversity over competing land use and single-sector objectives... employ UN SDG 15.3 ‘land degradation neutrality’ as a bottom line and benchmark... Existing planning instruments... should be reviewed to assess broader application and improved enforcement.
>
> *(Section 5, Recommendation 3)*



---

### UNLANDETHICS: Concept note of the World Commission on the Ethics of Scientific Knowledge and Technology (COMEST) on land-use ethics

**Question**: How can governance address power imbalances in land acquisition and resource extraction (e.g., land grabs, mining on indigenous land)?

**Evidence**: “In Africa, large-scale acquisition of land can take on the illusion of development despite the fact that few benefits actually trickle down to those who need them most... The consequences of land appropriation include the destruction of indigenous cultures, deterioration of farmland, loss of natural ecosystems and biodiversity, food and water insecurity, as well as corruption, social unrest, and cultural dislocation.” (I.2; II.1.1)

---

### NZOCEAN21: The breaking wave: reforming the oceans management system in Aotearoa New Zealand

**Question**: Market and property-rights structures (e.g., QMS) concentrate value and influence, challenging equitable transitions that consider nonhuman interests.

**Evidence**: “Value will flow to the owner of the scarcest resource... Where there is over-capacity in vessels... value will always flow to the owners of quota... Value will only sit with vessel owners when they become the scarce resource.” (Chapter 2.7)
“Quota landlords now hold all the power, the middlemen clip the ticket, and the fishermen doing the hard yards only earn a fraction of what the fish is worth.” (Chapter 2.7)

---

### EURIGHTS: Towards an EU Charter of the Fundamental Rights of Nature

**Question**: How can the EU mitigate lobbying and economic power imbalances that undermine ecological transformation?

**Evidence**: “Cons: The lobbying of economic and financial interests could condition the contents of the Rights of Nature, watering it down and producing mediocre results, risking the great challenges of change.” (Section 6.4.1, Economic issues (Eco1), p. 103)

---

### UNESCOAI23: Recommendation on the ethics of artificial intelligence

**Question**: How to engage LMICs and underrepresented groups in governance and ensure equitable benefit-sharing?

**Evidence**: 

> Emphasizing that specific attention must be paid to LMICs... as they have their own capacity but have been underrepresented in the AI ethics debate... strengthen global cooperation and solidarity... to ensure that national AI strategies are guided by ethical principles.
>
> *(Preamble)*



---

### IPANP24: The Undemocratic Origins Of The Nature Positive Plan

**Question**: Forum-shopping and process design minimize visibility and accountability in global biodiversity governance.

**Evidence**: “Forum shopping is a strategy for advancing agendas by building minor, seemingly non-threatening agreements in multiple arenas... The process by which we reached the commitment to ‘Nature Positive’ is very much an international Camel’s Nose process.” (p. 12–13)
“Forum shopping facilitates international agreement, but it can undermine sovereignty and accountability— as did the Paris Agreement— by subverting the constitutional requirement in the US for a qualified majority vote in the Senate for ratification.” (p. 13)

---

### UNBOL2023: Plurinational State of Bolivia position on Nature-Based Solutions – UNEP Consultation

**Question**: How to prevent planetary environmental neocolonialism and the dilution of CBDR through market-centric climate and biodiversity finance tools?

**Evidence**: “The concept of Nature-Based Solutions is an eurocentric and anthropocentric concept that promotes planetary environmental neocolonialism and framed within capitalism...” (p.1–2)
“...They are an instrument to dilute the responsibilities of developed countries and provide financing and means of implementation to developing countries, ignoring the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities...” (p.3)

---

### UNSECURITY24: Envisioning security for a more-than-human world

**Question**: How can we counteract structural effects of deregulated capitalism (e.g., agribusiness deflecting regulation) that drive planetary and health insecurity?

**Evidence**: “Recognizing the environmental and societal structural violence effected by unregulated capitalism is the first step... agribusiness... has unremittingly worked to deflect regulation on a global scale... ‘fewer government inspections... legislation against government surveillance and activist exposé...’” (Anthropocene / agribusiness section)

---

### ROMEECO22: Transforming our economies from ego to eco

**Question**: How can transformation overcome the political capture by special interests and the 'absencing' social field amplified by dark money and platform dynamics?

**Evidence**: “Two of the main drivers behind the rise of absencing are the socially destructive use of technology (specifically social media) and the increased influence of dark money on politics, particularly in the United States (Mayer, 2017). The success of both relies on an operating model that activates and amplifies ignorance, bias, hate, anger and fear.” (p. 5–6)

---

### UNESCOBIO11: Ethics and biodiversity

**Question**: Corruption and power imbalances undermine biodiversity protection and enforcement.

**Evidence**: “Cambodian development and environmental protection has been plagued by corruption and a lack of enforcement... For example Khim Sambor... was allegedly shot... He wrote articles... covering stories on corruption, illegal logging and deforestation, overfishing... With weak protection the environmental assets are vulnerable to overexploitation.” (4.7.4 Enforcement Procedures)

---

### DBIO23: Integrating biodiversity in urban development

**Question**: What political mechanisms are needed to complement design-led participation so that nonhuman representation has civic effect?

**Evidence**: “the language in the Arnstein ladder implies a political dimension that is not as explicitly adopted in biodiversity design approaches... suggests a direction for future research, where the proposed roles for biodiversity are discussed in line with specific ‘rungs’ on the ladder.” (4.1)

---

### IUCNWILD16: Wilderness protected areas: management guidelines for IUCN Category 1b protected areas

**Question**: Power asymmetries and historical injustices impede equitable co-governance with Indigenous Peoples.

**Evidence**: “In the majority of cases, conservation schemes were developed and superimposed on Indigenous Peoples’ and local communities’ territories without adequate consultation... This process resulted in gross violations of rights... undermines Indigenous Peoples’ well-being... Current trends suggest... new approaches are needed, including strengthened partnerships.” (1.6 Inclusion of Indigenous Peoples and local communities)

---

### NEHALF20: Narratives for the Half Earth and Sharing the Planet scenarios

**Question**: How can conservation shift burdens from local communities to powerful extra-local actors while improving equity?

**Evidence**: “some analysts... maintain that large conservation parties (e.g. the global upper class, land-owning capitalist s) should be those most targeted to change... up until now, much of the conservation pressure has been put onto the shoulders of local communities.” (Main findings)
“effective conservation governance starts ‘by addressing actors in the superordinate levels... then work down towards the local people in direct contact with the biodiversity in question’.” (5.3)

---

### PBLNATUREPOS22: Exploring nature-positive pathways: contribution to CBD Post-2020 GBF

**Question**: How to address power imbalances in rural landscapes and supply chains to ensure a just transition?

**Evidence**: “Considering the strategic role that rural landscapes play … it will be necessary to address power imbalances between multiple actors … Historically marginalised and oppressed groups … should be included and empowered to achieve a just transition.” (p. 19–21) “Special attention needs to be paid to a fair distribution of the costs and benefits … in such cross-border settings.” (p. 24)
