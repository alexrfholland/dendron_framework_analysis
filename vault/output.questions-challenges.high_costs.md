# HIGH_COSTS: High costs

## Sources and Questions

### ICNATUREPOS24: Blueprint for a Nature-Positive Adelaide

**Question**: How can projects manage prohibitive costs and reliance on volunteers to deliver and maintain BSUD outcomes?

**Evidence**: “Prohibitive project costs 9%... Many of the case study projects are supported or driven by volunteers... There can be an over-reliance on using volunteers for site maintenance, with the assumption that volunteer maintenance is ‘free’... high quality work with volunteers requires significant time investment by agencies.” (Figure 11; Section 6.3)
