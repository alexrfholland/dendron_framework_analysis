# SCI_DEBATES: Scientific debates

## Sources and Questions

### UNLAND17_3: The Global Land Outlook: Part 3 - A More Secure Future

**Question**: What is the role and effectiveness of competing agricultural paradigms (e.g., GM crops vs. conventional breeding; organic vs. chemical-intensive systems) in achieving sustainable food security?

**Evidence**: “What is the future for genetically modified crops? The industry and some governments think they are critical for agriculture. The experience in South Asia and Africa tells a very different story pointing to the failed promise of GM crops… A comparable GM variety is at least ten years away.” (Part Three – Conclusion: Thinking ahead)
“Will organic agriculture feed the world? Or any other kind of less intensive agriculture for that matter?… Would a large-scale switch to less chemical intensive systems cause a food crisis? … It is still too early to say whether organic agriculture will remain a niche market or become a major global food source.” (Part Three – Conclusion: Thinking ahead)

### IPANP24: The Undemocratic Origins Of The Nature Positive Plan

**Question**: Key scientific premises (species–area relationships, mass extinction claims, boundary-setting) remain contested and politicized.

**Evidence**: “Underpinning the claims that we are in the midst of the Sixth Mass Extinction... the species-area rule has drawn evidence substantial enough to amount to falsification... Instead, not one known species has been declared extinct... The extinctions forming the ‘Sixth Mass Extinction Event’ turn out to be virtual.” (p. 5)
“Dinerstein et al. (2017) was agenda-led ‘science-based opinion’. They then claimed that a scientific justification for a 50 per cent target was provided by that same editorial and a paper examining a regional conservation plan in South Africa...” (p. 9–10)
