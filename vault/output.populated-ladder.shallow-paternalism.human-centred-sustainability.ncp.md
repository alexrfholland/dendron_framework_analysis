### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### EUINVASIVE24: IPBES Invasive Alien Species Assessment: Chapter 1. Introducing Biological Invasions and the IPBES Thematic Assessment of Invasive Alien Species and Their Control

- **Organisation**: Roy
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the IPBES assessment uses NCP as a core conceptual device throughout, including explicit categories, links to good quality of life, and considerations of implications for invasive species’ impacts; it frames analysis and indicators conceptually but does not provide fully operationalized governance steps within this chapter.

- Context/synthesis: The chapter embeds NCP within the IPBES conceptual framework and elaborates 18 NCP categories used to assess IAS impacts. “Nature’s contributions to people are an integral part of the IPBES conceptual framework... Beneficial contributions... whereas detrimental contributions include transmission of disease... The IPBES invasive alien species assessment adopts the 18 categories identified by IPBES for reporting nature’s contributions to people.” (Section 1.6.1; Box 1.12)

- Context/synthesis: IAS impacts are explicitly framed via changes in NCP and quality of life, considering positive/negative effects and trade-offs. “For the purposes of this assessment, an impact is defined as a measurable change to nature, nature’s contributions to people, and/or good quality of life... Impacts can also be considered as harmful (negative) or beneficial (positive) for humans...” (Section 1.3.4)

- Context/synthesis: The chapter uses NCP to guide problem structuring and cross-cutting analysis (e.g., health, food security), including case examples (pollination networks). “As an example, alien species (plants and pollinators) comprised 56 percent of the total number of interactions within pollination networks on the Galápagos Islands... Such changes to the community structure increase network cohesiveness but disrupt native ecological interactions.” (Box 1.11)

### IMPLEMENTATION AND METRICS

#### NPOS25: Draft State of Nature Metrics

- **Organisation**: Nature Positive Initiative
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Applied/Practice-Based

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the NCP framework is explicitly referenced and modestly integrated conceptually (via triggering logic and scoping) but without a standalone, fully specified NCP indicator set or concrete policy mechanisms; NCP is acknowledged as less mature and used to inform other elements rather than implemented as a core, autonomous pillar.

- Context/synthesis: The report directly references NCP and describes how NCP considerations are woven into trigger logic for case-specific metrics, recognizing the framework but noting its current methodological immaturity. 

> Nature’s contributions to people metrics are less mature, however these considerations have been integrated into all species and ecosystems case-specific metrics triggers.
>
> *(Scope – Planned for 2025+)*


- Context/synthesis: It signals intent to revisit pressure–state interaction models and claims guidance in the future, situating NCP within a broader conceptual agenda for outcomes and benefits to people, yet without immediate operationalization. 

> Existing pressure-state interaction models will be assessed as part of work relating to claims guidance, however there is no intention to develop new models at this stage.
>
> *(Scope – Planned for 2025+)*

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### IPBESTCA2: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 2. Visions of a sustainable world – for nature and people

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the Nature’s Contributions to People (NCP) framework is explicitly and repeatedly used as a central analytic lens (e.g., coding outcomes and vision purposes), but it is applied in a human-centred way without concrete, actionable mechanisms for empowering nonhumans beyond instrumental valuation.

- The chapter operationalizes vision outcomes using NCP categories, showing explicit use of the framework to structure evidence and results: 

> Visions with higher levels of participation address a more comprehensive set of purposes and consider more comprehensive sets of direct and indirect drivers. A direct driver is a factor that unequivocally influences ecosystem processes... Data for panels (A) and (B) come from the transformative change assessment case study database... Nature’s contributions to people outcomes include 2.1: habitat creation and maintenance... 2.18: maintenance of options.
>
> *(Figure 2.7 caption)*


- NCP is embedded in a core empirical claim linking visioning to positive outcomes, reinforcing the framework’s centrality to the assessment: 

> Case studies of transformative change (n=391) that include explicit visions have more positive consequences for ecological, economic and social dimensions of sustainability than those without visions explicitly stated (Figure 2.7).

 The plotted outcome families explicitly include 

> Nature’s contributions to people

 categories. (Executive Summary; 2.3.5)

- The framework is used to classify the emphasis of visions and their purposes in the corpus: 

> An in-depth assessment... shows that around 62% of the visions assessed emphasize the promotion of sustainability, 63% focus on enhancing nature’s contributions to people and 70% focus on enhancing quality of life.
>
> *(Executive Summary, point 6)*


- Prevents higher score: although central to analysis, the NCP is framed instrumentally and not as a governance or practice mechanism that empowers nonhumans; the chapter does not set out concrete policy mechanisms for nonhuman decision-making based on NCP.

#### UNTRANS25: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 1. Transformative change and a sustainable world

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the chapter explicitly and repeatedly uses the IPBES Nature’s Contributions to People (NCP) framework to frame impacts and urgency, but only as a theoretical/diagnostic device rather than an operational policy mechanism for more-than-human empowerment. - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Humanity is utterly dependent on nature and yet, human activities are undermining the health and well-being of the living world at unprecedented levels... disrupting regulating and material contributions vital for functional ecosystems (e.g., nutrient cycling and flood regulation) (IPBES, 2022c).
>
> *(Section 1.2.1)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Biodiversity loss and nature’s decline have also been shown to exacerbate poverty and limit development. Over the past 50 years... Opportunities for inspiration, education, and recreation are being lost, as well as important contributions to sense of place, cultural diversity and religious or spiritual values...
>
> *(Section 1.2.1)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> The term 'polycrisis' emerged... and is used to refer to situations of interacting crises... The term recognizes the potential for crises to amplify and accelerate one another... These global sustainability crises have been noted to share common underlying political, economic and cultural causes.
>
> *(Section 1.2.1)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> The relationship between direct drivers, indirect drivers and underlying causes is depicted in Figure 1.3, which elaborates on figure SPM.2 from the IPBES Global Assessment... cross-cutting factors influencing all direct and indirect drivers were labelled 'values and behaviours'.
>
> *(Section 1.2.2)*

#### IPBESTCA4: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 4. Overcoming the challenges of achieving transformative change

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the chapter explicitly uses the Nature’s Contributions to People (NCP) term to frame impacts and knowledge transfer gaps, but it is not a central analytical lens nor operationalized with mechanisms; it remains part of contextual discussion. - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> The poor access of decision-makers, change agents, practitioners and Indigenous Peoples and local communities to sustainable knowledge and innovations, driven by ineffective knowledge transfer, can create a lack of awareness of the negative impacts of detrimental activities on biodiversity and nature’s contributions to people2 (Böhm & Collen, 2015; Folke et al., 2021; IPBES, 2019b; Raymond et al., 2010; Sachs et al., 2019).
>
> *(4.2.5)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> This chapter identifies the main challenges that prevent the translation of evidence and concern about biodiversity loss into transformative changes.

 While focused on biodiversity loss, the chapter repeatedly relates outcomes to effects on people and nature, aligning with NCP framing (Executive Summary)

#### IPBESPATHWAYS19: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 5. Realizing a sustainable world for nature and people: transformative strategies, actions and roles for all

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the Nature’s Contributions to People (NCP) framework is explicitly and repeatedly used to frame goals, metrics, and policy instruments (central to the chapter’s argument), but its focus is human-centred and not empowering nonhumans directly.

- NCP anchors the problem framing and urgency: 

> Without urgent action, effects of global environmental challenges and crises, including climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution, will undermine nature’s contributions to people...
>
> *(5.1)*


- The chapter links NCP to planning and management decisions and outcomes: 

> The integration and promotion of multiple contributions of nature to people in planning and management decisions are thus crucial components of transformative change.
>
> *(5.3.4)*


- NCP is tied to measurement and national accounting: 

> Alternative measures... supplement it to account for nature’s contributions to economic wellbeing (e.g., System of Environmental Economic Accounting – Ecosystem Accounts).
>
> *(5.5.4)*


- It also notes a needed shift beyond instrumental to include relational and intrinsic values alongside NCP: 

> Most existing options for actors have predominantly focused on instrumental values of nature. Their expansion to include options that reflect relational and intrinsic values of nature is visible...
>
> *(Exec. summary, point 12)*

#### IBPESWILD22: Chapter 2: Conceptualizing the sustainable use of wild species

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the chapter repeatedly and explicitly integrates ecosystem services/Nature’s Contributions to People as a defining, human-centred lens for sustainable use, discussing implications and indicator needs but not operationalizing more-than-human empowerment beyond anthropocentric benefits (by definition of NCP). 

- The report foregrounds ecosystem services/NCP within sustainable use, highlighting their centrality and policy implications: 

> There is growing focus on a wider range of ecosystem services provided by sustainable use, acknowledgement of the need to co-produce information across diverse knowledge systems when evaluating sustainability or seeking more sustainable practices
>
> *(Executive Summary, point 3)*

.

- It embeds NCP in global standards and guidance, noting explicit mention of avoiding impacts on NCP: 

> The Addis Ababa Principles and Guidelines... include topics such as... avoidance of impacts on nature’s contributions to people
>
> *(2.2.2.2)*

.

- It treats NCP as a key element within policy frameworks that guide practice: 

> Within those broad categories, the following concepts are present in sustainable use key elements: ... Avoidance of impacts on nature’s contributions to people
>
> *(Executive Summary, point 6)*

.

- The indicator section diagnoses gaps consistent with an NCP framing, emphasizing socio-cultural linkages: 

> there remain gaps around indicators that convey social-ecological linkages and socio-cultural benefits

 and calls for combining ILK with scientific monitoring (Executive Summary, point 11).

#### IPBESMODELS46: Report of the IPBES task force on scenarios and models – Nature Futures Scenarios

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the IPBES report uses the IPBES conceptual framing of 'nature’s contributions to people' extensively in theory and as a structuring lens for indicators/scenarios, but remains within anthropocentric modelling aims; as a Paternalism-rung framework this is a core focus without concrete empowerment of nonhumans.

- Central framing: “Based on the draft description of the NFF and its methodological guidance, the task force conducts a series of consultations… to catalyse the development of the next generation of scenarios… to support IPBES assessments on biodiversity and ecosystem services.” (Introduction)

- Indicator structure includes NCP explicitly: “These potential metrics included… indicators of nature’s contributions to people (e.g., on pollination, climate mitigation, food production), and of good quality of life…” (III.C)

- Modelling questions target human-centred policy goals while considering nature: “Applications of the NFF could help identify options for interventions to support the achievement of policy goals such as the Sustainable Development Goals or targets under the post-2020 global biodiversity framework…” (Executive summary)

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### PBLCITIES21: Realising the Urban Opportunity: Cities and the Post-2020 Biodiversity Governance

- **Organisation**: PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the policy brief explicitly leverages the IPBES Nature’s Contributions to People (NCP) framework to frame urban biodiversity governance, arguing for embedding this perspective in the GBF, but it remains conceptual and human-centred, without concrete mechanisms for direct nonhuman empowerment (as expected at the Paternalism rung).

- The brief grounds its urban agenda in NCP, linking city benefits to biodiversity: “There is now a growing interest in the potential of nature-based solutions in cities globally to enable resilience to climate change and meet sustainable development goals… while the benefits of urban nature to human health and well-being are increasingly acknowledged… Cities can therefore play an important role not only in conserving and restoring nature, but also in ensuring that society can thrive with nature (Xie and Bulkeley, 2020).” (Introduction)

- It repeatedly calls for sustaining NCP as part of transformative governance: “Addressing the direct and indirect drivers of biodiversity loss while realising the benefits of nature’s contribution to people is central to the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF)… the next landmark agreement…” (Introduction)

- The paper explicitly invokes the IPBES Global Assessment and NCP to justify co-benefits and mainstreaming in cities: “In 2019, the IPBES Global Assessment called for a wider acknowledgement of the importance not only of conserving and restoring biodiversity, but sustaining and enhancing Nature’s Contributions to People (NCP)… This explicit recognition that what is at stake… is… the contribution that nature makes to society clearly establishes a basis for recognising that action to support biodiversity can generate important co-benefits.” (Section 3.3)

- It argues for embedding an urban perspective in the GBF’s theory of change, targets and indicators, consistent with extending an NCP lens: “First, an urban perspective must be integrated throughout the GBF — from the theory of change to the reporting, monitoring and verification process and beyond… embedding urban action requires a Target & Indicator framework that is fit for purpose… recognising that many of the Targets cannot be achieved without urban action…” (Sections 4.1, 4.2)

#### IMFNAT: Embedded in nature: nature-related economic and financial risks and policy considerations

- **Organisation**: IMF
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the note defines and uses ecosystem services/NCP conceptually to frame macro-financial dependencies, but applies it in an anthropocentric risk lens rather than empowering nonhuman agency.

- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Ecosystem services are 'a range of material and non‑material benefits that humans, directly and indirectly, obtain from nature and that sustain and fulfil human life (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005), also described as ‘nature’s benefit to people’ in the IPBES conceptual framework (Díaz et al. 2015)' (NGFS 2022a).
>
> *(Glossary)*


- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> The economy is embedded in nature: it is part of, and dependent on, natural resources and processes for its existence and functioning... The stability of ecosystems ultimately underpins all economic activity.

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### EUECOSERVG2021: Ecosystem services accounting – part III

- **Organisation**: JRC, EC
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because the report explicitly references the IPBES Nature’s Contributions to People (NCP) classification to situate ecosystem services (e.g., water purification) but only as a crosswalk and contextual reference, not as a core guiding or operational framework for the assessment or accounting design.

- The report situates water purification within the IPBES NCP categories but does not use NCP as the basis for methods or decisions: 

> In IPBES (Diaz et al., 2018), the water purification service is included mainly in the reporting category of nature’s contributions to people – ‘Regulation of freshwater and coastal water quality’ (examples are the regulation by ecosystems or particular organisms of the quality of water by filtration of particles, pathogens, excess nutrients and other chemicals).
>
> *(Chapter 5. Water purification)*


- The text uses IPBES/NCP to align terminology rather than to shape the accounting structure or policy mechanism: 

> However, it has been noted that, for bioremediation and water quality maintenance services, there are overlapping classes in CICES that are hard to discriminate in a practical assessment context (Czúcz et al., 2018).
>
> *(Chapter 5.1)*

#### EUONEHEALTH24: One Health governance in the European Union

- **Organisation**: SAPEA
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because the concept of nature’s contributions to people is explicitly invoked in the research agenda, but not elaborated as a formal framework within the report’s governance machinery.

- The report’s research gap section uses the precise concept-name and frames it as a key analytic for One Health valuation: 

> How can we best understand and value nature’s contributions to people, particularly from the health perspective?
>
> *(Chapter 5 – Research gaps: Biodiversity)*


- This is a prompt for future work rather than an operationalised NCP framework in the EU context.
