**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the Gaia hypothesis is explicitly cited to underscore planetary interdependence and to motivate a ‘wise governance’ approach, but without proposing Gaia-based institutions.

- Context/synthesis: “The biologists Lynn Margulis and James Lovelock even suggested that planet Earth could be viewed as a supra-organism in their Gaia hypothesis... it has directed attention to the many finely regulated cycles and networks of the biosphere, and how human survival depends on ecosystem health.” (p.8)
