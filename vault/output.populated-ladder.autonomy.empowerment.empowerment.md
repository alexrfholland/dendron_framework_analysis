- **Organisation**: Clay
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Humanities/Ethics

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the article discusses empowering individual animals in captivity conceptually (via choice and control), but does not present concrete governance mechanisms; it frames empowerment as a welfare practice rather than a binding institutional proposal.

- Context/synthesis: The author highlights empowerment via choices and control as a core ethical responsibility of modern zoos. “Current animal welfare practices in zoos focus on understanding the emotional states of animals to adhere to their interests and empower them through providing opportunities to, among other things, choose which conspecifics to interact with, what to eat, and whether to hide or remain in public view.” (Main text)

- Context/synthesis: It questions whether individual empowerment can be meaningfully achieved in an inherently artificial context prioritizing species conservation and public display, indicating conceptual limitations. “The question is to know if it is possible to adequately adhere to individual animal interests within an artificial context where individual animals fundamentally represent ‘other’ collective populations and species in the wild.” (Main text)
