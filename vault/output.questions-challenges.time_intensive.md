## Sources and Questions

### DWILD20: Designing wildlife-inclusive cities

**Question**: How to handle the time it takes for species colonization and for social acceptance, while maintaining project momentum?

**Evidence**: “target species may take some time to settle… In the case of ‘The Living Alster’, monitoring indicated that… further measures and more time may be needed to fully reach the biodiversity targets.” (3.1)
“not everybody took the opportunity to contribute… long-term education… may be means to reduce fears and increase understanding.” (3.1)

### D4C25: Design for Environmental Conservation (Toolkit)

**Question**: What process and resourcing barriers limit genuine co-design (availability, trust, hospitality, inclusion) and how can they be addressed?

**Evidence**: “co-design comes with its own set of difficulties… limited resources like time, funding, and access to key stakeholders’ trust… the most significant challenge is often participant availability… past negative experiences… can lead to understandable hesitance to re-engage.” (Ch.3)
