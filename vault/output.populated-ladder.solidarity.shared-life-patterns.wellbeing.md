### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### UNSECURITY24: Envisioning security for a more-than-human world

- **Organisation**: UNDP
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the paper argues for shifting metrics and policy towards well-being alongside sustainability and equity, tying to HDI adjustments, yet it does not present a specific well-being governance instrument. - It proposes metric reform: “We need to strategize the ‘indicators’ of security we elevate and measure... the ‘planetary pressures-adjusted HDI’ is... aimed at ‘reimagining the human development journey as one in which the expanding human freedoms also ease planetary pressures’.” (Metrics section) - It aligns with WiSE: “WiSE... seeks to transcend how ‘politics, media and economists traditionally focus on economic growth’... producing a ‘holistic framework’ that ‘values human well-being, environmental protection and equity for all’.” (WiSE section)

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### IPBESTCA2: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 2. Visions of a sustainable world – for nature and people

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because wellbeing is woven throughout as a core aim of visions (including 'wellbeing for all within planetary boundaries') and as an outcome domain in the evidence synthesis, but remains conceptual rather than methodologically operationalized here.

- A focal inspiring vision is framed around wellbeing integrated with planetary limits: 

> Wellbeing for all within planetary boundaries... Goals include reducing inequality... shifting the economic agenda away from continuous growth, while offering dignity for humans and other-than-human beings, including ecosystems and biodiversity.
>
> *(Table 2.1)*


- Wellbeing outcomes are part of the measured effects of visions: 

> Case studies of transformative change... have more positive consequences for ecological, economic and social dimensions of sustainability... Socio-economic outcomes include 1.1: good quality of life... 1.19: access to health...
>
> *(Figure 2.7 and caption)*


- Prevents higher score: the chapter does not detail specific wellbeing indicators or governance mechanisms linked to nonhuman empowerment.

#### EUONEHEALTH24: One Health governance in the European Union

- **Organisation**: SAPEA
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because wellbeing is explicitly and repeatedly employed as a key outcome measure and guiding concept (quality of life, equitable distribution, resilience) across human, animal, and environmental health, but the report does not propose a standalone wellbeing governance mechanism beyond integration within One Health.

- The report extends OHHLEP to link health and wellbeing as core One Health outcomes, guiding indicators and monitoring: 

> Although One Health has historically focused on infectious diseases, OHHLEP’s definition recalls the importance of linking health and wellbeing... beyond the presence or absence of disease to encompass: quality of life and the ability of people and societies to contribute to the world with a sense of meaning and purpose... Focusing on wellbeing supports the tracking of the equitable distribution of resources, overall thriving and sustainability.
>
> *(EU policies – The Quadripartite and OHHLEP)*


- It encourages using wellbeing to frame trade-offs, equity, and resilience in One Health policy, thus shaping goals and criteria for success: 

> A One Health approach thus becomes an implicit prerequisite, if the global community is to achieve the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)... A society’s wellbeing can be determined by the extent to which it is resilient, builds capacity for action, and is prepared to transcend challenges.
>
> *(EU policies – The Quadripartite and OHHLEP)*


- It links wellbeing with non-communicable diseases, mental health, and environmental determinants, broadening beyond anthropocentric disease control: 

> Social pathologies... as well as their positive corollaries... are human health concepts that could benefit from, and perhaps be transformed by, a One Health approach... Engagement with ‘nature’ and animals is highly beneficial for mental health...
>
> *(One Health definition – Sociocultural considerations)*

#### IPBESPATHWAYS19: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 5. Realizing a sustainable world for nature and people: transformative strategies, actions and roles for all

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because wellbeing is explicitly proposed as a central metric and goal for economic systems and learning outcomes, but without a distinct wellbeing governance framework that directly empowers nonhumans.

- The chapter proposes wellbeing economies and measures: 

> Revising goals, metrics and indicators of progress can lead to diverse valuation of nature... Alternative measures integrating other economic, social (including cultural) and environmental dimensions are available to measure progress.
>
> *(5.5.4)*


- It links wellbeing to just transitions and policy instruments: 

> Instruments such as increased taxes or fines on nature-damaging activities... are options for just transformations to sustainable wellbeing economies.
>
> *(Exec. summary, point 6)*

## Score 1: Token Acknowledgement

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### UNLAND17_1: The Global Land Outlook: Part 1 - The Big Picture

- **Organisation**: UNCCD
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because wellbeing is referenced repeatedly as an aim and benefit of land stewardship and ecosystem services, but not developed as a formal framework with indicators or governance mechanisms.

- Wellbeing is a recurring destination in the Outlook’s vision: 

> This Outlook presents a vision for transforming the way in which we use and manage land. It underscores how land is the key to human security and future wellbeing, the thread that holds together the fabric of society.
>
> *(Foreword, p. 7)*


- The report links natural ecosystems to physical and mental wellbeing, but as descriptive benefits rather than an operational wellbeing framework: 

> Natural ecosystems are increasingly recognized as important places that promote physical and mental health and well-being.
>
> *(Chapter 4, Convergence of Evidence, ‘Physical and mental health’, p. 70)*


- It notes economic valuation of wellbeing gains from nature exposure without systematizing wellbeing metrics or institutions: 

> In Scotland, the health benefits of woodlands have been estimated at between USD 17.6–23.6 million per year… through increased physical exercise, reduced air pollution, savings in mental health costs, and reduced absence from work.
>
> *(Chapter 4, p. 70)*
