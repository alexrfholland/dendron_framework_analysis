## Score 4: Actionable Mechanisms

*No sources at this score level*

## Score 3: Core Conceptual Device / Implications Explored

### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### UNESCOEDU20: Learning to become with the world: education for future survival

- **Organisation**: Common Worlds/UNESCO
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Humanities/Ethics

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the source adopts ‘mutual flourishing of all – human and more than human’ as an explicit educational aim and develops implications (recuperative ethics, shared survival) and criteria (living well together on a damaged planet) but not concrete policy instruments. - The envisioned ethical stance centers mutual flourishing across species: 

> By letting go of the grandiose fantasies of humans saving the environment, we have now been able to focus on the much more modest goal of collaboratively attending to the mutual flourishing of all – human and more than human – and on recuperating our damaged common worlds together, even if only partial recuperation is possible.
>
> *(Visionary declarations, 7)*

 - They frame thriving as surviving well together on a damaged Earth: 

> Education’s new remit is to promote ecological justice by teaching the arts of living respectfully and responsibly on a damaged planet... and learning how to survive well together (Haraway, 2016).
>
> *(Visionary declarations, 1)*

 - The paper positions ‘living well’ and ‘survival’ as shared outcomes of more-than-human cohabitation: 

> We are enthusiastically undertaking the collective task of learning with those in our common worlds, as a mode of remaking these worlds together.
>
> *(Visionary declarations, 5)*

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### UNESCOAI23: Recommendation on the ethics of artificial intelligence

- **Organisation**: UNESCO
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the Recommendation centrally advances 'Environment and ecosystem flourishing' as a value with implications across principles and policy areas (e.g., environmental EIA, incentives for ecosystem-supporting AI), but it does not create a legal rights regime for nonhuman flourishing. - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Environment and ecosystem flourishing should be recognized, protected and promoted through the life cycle of AI systems... environment and ecosystems are the existential necessity for humanity and other living beings to be able to enjoy the benefits of advances in AI.
>
> *(III.1 Values)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> All actors involved in the life cycle of AI systems must comply with applicable international law... designed for environmental and ecosystem protection and restoration... reduce the environmental impact of AI systems, including but not limited to its carbon footprint...
>
> *(III.1 Values)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Member States and business enterprises should assess the direct and indirect environmental impact throughout the AI system life cycle... and reduce the environmental impact of AI systems and data infrastructures.
>
> *(Policy Area 5: Environment and Ecosystems)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Member States should introduce incentives... to ensure the development and adoption of rights-based and ethical AI-powered solutions for disaster risk resilience; the monitoring, protection and regeneration of the environment and ecosystems...
>
> *(Policy Area 5)*

#### UNBOL2023: Plurinational State of Bolivia position on Nature-Based Solutions – UNEP Consultation

- **Organisation**: UNEP
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because ‘Living Well’ (Buen Vivir) is explicitly advanced as a flourishing framework for humans and more-than-human communities, with consequences for rights recognition, education, and policy.

- Context/synthesis: The text indicates a goal of continuity for ‘all living beings and their communities,’ i.e., flourishing of more-than-human communities: 

> promotes the continuity of all living beings and their communities and ensures the non-commodification of the environmental functions of Mother Earth.
>
> *(Annex definition)*


- Context/synthesis: It requires integrating ‘Living Well’ into governance and educational processes, mapping to goals and indicators of success (e.g., consolidation of communities of life): 

> f) Develop pedagogical and educational processes related to the Living Well in harmony and balance with Mother Earth... h) Promote the consolidation of communities of life...
>
> *(Annex)*

## Score 2: Theoretical Treatment

### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### ROMEECO22: Transforming our economies from ego to eco

- **Organisation**: Club of Rome
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the text repeatedly orients toward 'wellbeing for all' and 'planetary healing', acknowledging the flourishing of the whole ecosystem conceptually, but without detailing institutional criteria or indicators for nonhuman thriving.

- The paper’s stated aim is broader wellbeing and planetary healing: 

> key leverage points for moving the system towards planetary healing and wellbeing for all?
>
> *(p. 1)*


- Proposed shifts include 'ecosystem leadership' and 'organising around emerging futures', which conceptually expand beyond humans but do not specify how nonhuman flourishing is measured or governed: 

> Ecosystem leadership … Organising around emerging futures … Wellbeing for all …
>
> *(Table 1, p. 9)*


- The learning infrastructures aim at 'democratise access to transformation literacy' for systems, but there is no explicit metricization of nonhuman thriving: 

> The goal should be to democratise access to transformation literacy.
>
> *(p. 13)*

#### EUANTHRO: Exiting the Anthropocene? Exploring fundamental change in our relationship with nature

- **Organisation**: EEA
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the briefing proposes multispecies ‘flourishment’ (‘working for multispecies flourishment’) as an outcome criterion of the Symbiocene/Chthulucene narrative, though it does not specify indicators.

- Context/synthesis: “working for multispecies flourishment.” (p.9)

- Context/synthesis: It argues governance should align needs and concerns of humans and other organisms (‘all of us’), implying co-flourishing as a goal (Key messages; p.14).

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### IPBESTCA2: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 2. Visions of a sustainable world – for nature and people

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because thriving is a central normative end-state applied to both people and nature throughout the chapter, establishing a more-than-human destination conceptually, though without concrete mechanisms.

- The chapter’s purpose statement centers a thriving world for nature and people: 

> Positive visions about collective futures where biodiversity, nature and people thrive are influential, if not indispensable, stimuli for desirable changes.
>
> *(2.2.1)*


- The conclusions reiterate this end-state and the need for paradigm shifts: 

> Global visions show that transitioning towards a planet where both nature and people thrive is possible, but in most cases, it will need fundamental changes in mindsets and current paradigms about human-nature relationships...
>
> *(2.5)*


- Prevents higher score: thriving remains an aspirational framing rather than an operational framework with indicators or institutionalization in this chapter.

#### IPBESPATHWAYS19: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 5. Realizing a sustainable world for nature and people: transformative strategies, actions and roles for all

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because thriving is explicitly invoked as an outcome framing linked to nature-inclusive learning and care; it recognizes flourishing beyond humans implicitly, but the chapter does not formalize a thriving framework with institutionally specific mechanisms for nonhuman flourishing.

- The chapter uses “thriving” as an explicit goal of transformation: 

> Transformative learning... to promote a thriving, equitable and resilient future.
>
> *(Exec. summary, point 11)*


- It frames living ‘as nature’ and flourishing across multispecies relations: 

> Encouraging multifaceted engagement with nature... helps cultivate recognition that humans are part of nature and can live as nature... fostering a culture of care that values nature and social justice.
>
> *(Exec. summary, point 10)*

#### EUHORIZON23: Horizon Europe strategic plan 2025–2027 analysis

- **Organisation**: European Commission
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the document explicitly recognises flourishing on nonhuman terms within a futures framework (negotiating with other inhabitants to allow all to flourish), signalling recognition of nonhuman thriving; however, it does not specify policy or practice mechanisms that would monitor or secure nonhuman flourishing in decision-making.

- The foresight lens explicitly frames goals as 

> allow all to flourish on their own terms

 across human and other entities, linking to negotiation in shared spaces: 

> Negotiate with other inhabitants of critical zones to allow all to flourish on their own terms; adapt to nature and its diversity.
>
> *(Section 1.4 – Table on flourishing ecosystems, Caring within hybrid collectives)*


- This thriving horizon reorients success criteria for ecosystems and research trajectories (e.g., empathy, hybrid collectives) beyond human-only metrics. (Section 1.4)

- There are no concrete indicators or governance structures proposed to measure or ensure nonhuman flourishing, keeping it at a conceptual recognition level.

#### SIPSECURITY21: Anthropocene (in)securities: reflections on collective survival 50 years after Stockholm

- **Organisation**: SIPRI
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the volume explicitly recognizes the need for nonhuman flourishing as part of security and legal thinking, using it as a moral foundation and goal, but it does not specify operational flourishing metrics or institutional mandates tied to this goal.

- Context/synthesis: It centers future security around enabling the flourishing of diverse beings and worlds, not merely human safety. 

> We need to treasure the declaration’s achievements but push on with legal, institutional and ethical innovations that can secure all the beings and worlds that share the earth.
>
> *(Chapter 7 – The legacy of the Stockholm Declaration)*


- Context/synthesis: It articulates flourishing as an outcome of entangled security, implying criteria for success based on collective survival and wellbeing beyond the human. 

> We make the case for a holistic, lived and plural sense of security, oriented towards solidarity and kinship across species...
>
> *(Afterword – Trajectories for security)*

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### EURIGHTS: Towards an EU Charter of the Fundamental Rights of Nature

- **Organisation**: EESC
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because 'thriving' is used to frame goals (humans thrive with Nature) and motivate the legal shift, but it is not developed into a distinct policy framework with mechanisms separate from the Rights of Nature Charter.

- Framing explicit: 

> We are Nature... When Nature thrives, we thrive. When Nature dies, we die.
>
> *(Executive Summary, p. 4)*


- Outcome orientation: 

> A new societal blueprint encoded in law... can be a stepping stone to recalibrating society to thrive in harmony with Nature in the long term, ensuring the rights of future generations.
>
> *(Executive Summary, p. 5)*

### SCENARIOS AND FUTURES EXPLORATION

#### PBLNATUREPOS22: Exploring nature-positive pathways: contribution to CBD Post-2020 GBF

- **Organisation**: PBL Netherlands EA
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report frequently emphasizes that futures should enable nature and people to thrive, but it does not establish indicators/criteria uniquely for nonhuman flourishing beyond biodiversity indicators.

- Explicit aim to create cities where 'people and nature can thrive together': “Moving forward requires combining… creating cities where people and nature can thrive together.” (p. 26)

- Nature-positive explicitly defined beyond protected areas toward overall restoration and recovery targets: “shifts the objective from halting biodiversity loss to reversing it and restoring nature also beyond conservation areas.” (p. 16)

- Multiple values and justice orientation to sustain thriving: “Achieving ambitious nature goals must happen within a framework of multiple values of nature in which attention to justice is essential.” (p. 9)

#### NESTORIES24: Mapping and analysis of alternative growth paradigms: towards a taxonomy and storylines

- **Organisation**: MultiFutures/TNO
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because ‘Living Well’/wellbeing and co-sufficiency are used to define outcomes across scenarios (beyond GDP), but the document is a mapping and scenario scoping exercise.

- Context/synthesis: The Post-Growth storyline aims for a ‘wellbeing’ dashboard and budgets, reorienting outcomes beyond GDP: “A ‘wellbeing’ dashboard of indicators and accompanying budgets are developed for this purpose.” (p.46)

- Context/synthesis: Great Mindshift centers on local self-sufficiency and multispecies care (rights for nature), indicating thriving criteria (p.46).

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### UNESCOEDU21: Reimagining our futures together: a new social contract for education

- **Organisation**: UNESCO
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report repeatedly invokes flourishing and sustainable futures for all and improving the existence of all living beings, but it remains primarily human-focused in implementation. - UNESCO frames its scope as improving life for all living beings: 

> Like the reports that preceded it, the Sahle-Work Commission report is broadening the conversation on philosophies and principles needed to guide education to improve the existence of all living beings on this planet.
>
> *(Foreword, Director-General)*

 - It speaks of flourishing futures: 

> The right to quality education everywhere and learning that builds the capabilities of individuals to work together for shared benefit provide the foundation for flourishing, diverse futures of education.
>
> *(Foreword, Chair)*

#### SCTRANSS25: Environment strategy for Scotland – transformative changes for sustainability

- **Organisation**: Scottish Government
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because flourishing of more-than-human life is an articulated goal (collective wellbeing, regenerative relationships), used to frame outcomes and indicators, but not codified as its own policy framework here.

- The report sets flourishing earthly life as a guiding ambition for futures work and policy: 

> By speculating and perhaps prefiguring such futures in practice, this can inform broader governmental and other actors’ strategies and actions for flourishing earthly life.
>
> *(Foreword)*


- It proposes including nonhuman wellbeing in national indicators, formalising thriving as an evaluation criterion: 

> Promote assessment of wellbeing (human, non-human) in national indicators, foregrounding indicators such as autonomy and solidarity...
>
> *(Table 3: Economic levers)*

## Score 1: Token Acknowledgement

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### EUONEHEALTH24: One Health governance in the European Union

- **Organisation**: SAPEA
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because the report uses 'thriving' as an outcome linked to wellbeing and sustainability in One Health contexts, but does not develop a separate thriving framework or metrics for nonhuman flourishing beyond general indicators.

- The report ties thriving to wellbeing and equity in One Health outcomes: 

> Focusing on wellbeing supports the tracking of the equitable distribution of resources, overall thriving and sustainability.
>
> *(EU policies – The Quadripartite and OHHLEP)*


- Flourishing/Thriving is invoked as an outcome concept rather than a standalone governance framework.
