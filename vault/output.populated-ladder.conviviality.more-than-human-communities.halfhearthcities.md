#### IUCNBUILD25: Catalysing biodiversity on buildings: a review of supporting initiatives in European cities

- **Organisation**: IUCN
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Design/Engineering

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the ‘Half Earth City’ concept is referenced as a motivating vision and scholarly frame, with the report illustrating building-scale operational ideas, but without a fully articulated Half-Earth-City policy package in this document. - The report links explicitly to The Half Earth City scholarship: “Beatley, T. and Brown, JD (2021). The Half Earth City.” (Executive Summary, footnote 1) - It operationalizes elements through building-scale biodiversity (cohabitation, connectivity, metrics), but not a full citywide Half Earth blueprint: “focusing on building-site greening... contribute substantially to urban biodiversity... innovative ways in which biodiversity can be supported particularly in dense urban areas...” (2.1)
