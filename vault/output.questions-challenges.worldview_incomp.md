# WORLDVIEW_INCOMP: Incompatible worldviews

## Sources and Questions

### ISCHEALTH21: Urban health and wellbeing in the Anthropocene: interdisciplinary science-action plan 2021–2025

**Question**: How can shifting societal values in the Anthropocene be reconciled with economic and governance systems to support planetary health?

**Evidence**: 

> The Anthropocene fundamentally changes societal values, which are the bedrock of economics. Ideas of progress and wealth are being re-thought and re-imagined and there is a sense of urgency as we are being told that we are approaching tipping points and carrying capacities and that cascading effects undermine our attempts to be stewards of the earth.

### UNCITIES21: Global environment outlook for cities – towards green and just cities (GEO for Cities)

**Question**: How can cities negotiate divergent worldviews about the moral and political status of nonhumans to advance multispecies governance?

**Evidence**: “This will constitute a challenging thought experiment, since some non-human species can be disease vectors that threaten human health... Yet multispecies cities are unavoidable... preparing people for new animals that may appear in their cities as a result of climate change or biodiversity loss…” (Chapter 4, 4.2.3)
“Such an approach encompasses the idea of a city that respects nature and protects and restores the diversity of life, and involves choices on urban form, land use and property...” (Chapter 4, 4.2.3)

### SCTRANSS25: Environment strategy for Scotland – transformative changes for sustainability

**Question**: How can plural ontologies (relational/pluriversal, Indigenous cosmologies) be integrated without extraction or scientisation of knowledge?

**Evidence**: “Giving space to plural forms of knowledge – including positivist environmental sciences, but also embracing the arts, critical social sciences and humanities and community perspectives is key... Scientific scenarios... which integrate Indigenous values... fail to recognise the incommensurability of these different forms of knowledge, and may thus become extractive, appropriating without acknowledgement, or scientizing Indigenous knowledge.” (Foreword; 7.3 Social and cultural policy instruments)

---

### EUCLIM24: Towards sustainable transformation: research priorities in climate change and biodiversity

**Question**: How can governance shift away from anthropocentrism towards multispecies justice and one-nature framings?

**Evidence**: 

> Much of the biodiversity debate has focused on the concept of multispecies justice... which both stress the need to move away from anthropocentrism.
>
> *(Section 4.2)*

### TWITRANS18: Transformations to achieve the sustainable development goals

**Question**: How can societies shift mindsets, values, and norms to integrate people-and-planet governance consistent with a safe operating space?

**Evidence**: “The transformations to sustainable development will require profound normative, societal, political and institutional changes… Thus, for the first time in human history, in the Anthropocene humans need to take responsibility to stabilize the planet itself– a civilizational shift in perspective is required.” (Putting governance, values and policy tools into the center)
“Placing society at the center of the sustainability debate is the next quantum jump that we have to implement in our thinking… If humanity is to re-equilibrate with the environment, that will have to come from changes in mindsets, societal structures and human behavior.” (2.1.1 Placing society at the core)

---

### STOCK50: Stockholm+50: unlocking a better future

**Question**: How do divergent values (intrinsic vs instrumental, care vs extraction) and knowledge systems impede consensus and implementation?

**Evidence**:  

> Repairing the relationship between people and nature will require redressing this imbalance, by placing more emphasis on the intrinsic and relational value of nature... Recognize Indigenous local knowledge and the Rights of Nature...
>
> *(Summary; Recommendations)*

### UNLAND17_1: The Global Land Outlook: Part 1 - The Big Picture

**Question**: How can diverse epistemologies (e.g., Indigenous geomythology and Western geoscience) be integrated to guide sustainable land governance?

**Evidence**: 

> The Eurocentric worldview requires science to be firmly separated from ‘folklore.’ If we are to honestly contemplate the cultural and spiritual values of the land, these assumptions need to be fundamentally re-examined… An understanding and integration of those different books into a hybrid knowledge system must, surely, be a fundamental prerequisite for building the diverse bridges necessary for sustainable development.
>
> *(Chapter 1, Box 1.1 Geomythology, p. 26)*

### EIVIS23: Exploring new visions for a sustainable bioeconomy

**Question**: How can bioeconomy governance reconcile and pivot away from dominant anthropocentric worldviews towards relational, pluriversal ontologies?

**Evidence**: “Our dominant worldview in the West has been very anthropocentric... Perspectives from diverse indigenous cultures and state-of-the-art scientific findings both suggest that human exceptionalism and a sense of individual sovereignty is misplaced– a worldview of deep interconnection between all natural entities is more valid... This presents a challenge requiring a deeper reframing of bioeconomy strategy based on a fundamental pivot in conceptions of human-nature relationships.” (p. 15-16)

---

### EUINVASIVE24: IPBES Invasive Alien Species Assessment: Chapter 1. Introducing Biological Invasions and the IPBES Thematic Assessment of Invasive Alien Species and Their Control

**Question**: How can diverse ethical frameworks and value systems (e.g., rights of nature, compassionate conservation, utilitarian approaches) be reconciled in IAS management?

**Evidence**: - Context/synthesis: The chapter foregrounds conflicting ethical perspectives and their practical ramifications. “There are philosophical differences between proponents of animal rights... and those who focus on conservation... the extension of legal rights to animals and nature... the interests of individual animals may conflict with interests of individual species...” (Section 1.5.3)

- Context/synthesis: It also reflects on the role of language/framing in societal acceptance and governance choices. “The language used to describe invasive alien species has sometimes been labelled as nativist... Shackelford et al. (2013) suggest finding middle-ground in the native/non-native debate...” (Section 1.5.3)

---

### EUSTI50: S&T&I for 2050: science, technology and innovation for ecosystem performance – accelerating sustainability transitions

**Question**: Competing and sometimes incompatible worldviews about law, value, and nature hinder adoption of robust Rights of Nature and representation mechanisms.

**Evidence**: “Approaches to implementing rights of nature are not without difficulty... how might one begin to arbitrate the right of a rabbit to prey on a gardener’s lettuce; a hawk to prey on a rabbit; a virus to reproduce in a host... or the rights of marine life against property rights or energy access rights (issues of competing interest)?” (4.1.2 Limitations)
“Ultimately, rights of nature proponents argue that granting nature legal personhood is essential... With current environmental law often poorly implemented, prospects of legitimate granting and defence of rights for nature to ensure thriving ecologies seem bleak.” (4.1.2 Limitations)

---

### UNPLANETBOUND22: Thematic study: planetary boundaries

**Question**: How can risk governance overcome the human–nature dichotomy and embed non-anthropocentric ethics that prioritize the more-than-human world alongside human wellbeing?

**Evidence**: “Systemic risk governance must overcome the false dichotomy between humans and their environment and embrace non-anthropocentric ethical care principles, which prioritise protection of the ‘more-than-human world’ in addition to human well-being.” (Part 2.2, Goal)

---

### EUHRPLAN21: Human rights for the planet

**Question**: How can European human rights law reconcile anthropocentric baselines with ecocentric or biocentric approaches that recognize nature’s value in its own right?

**Evidence**: “The case law of international tribunals will be the topic of our first panel today, which will discuss the so-called anthropocentric and the ecocentric approaches to human rights... The ecocentric approach... is the one centered on the protection of our common home, our environment, our planet.” (Opening – Judge Sicilianos)
“First, is there a room in the European human rights law for a biocentric or immersive anthropocentric vision... Secondly, could we go one step farther and take an ecocentric approach according to which nature has a value of its own, that is to say, irrespective of any benefits that it may generate for humans?” (Overview of ECtHR environmental case-law)

---

### EUNATURERIGHTS21: Can nature get it right? Rights of Nature in the European context

**Question**: How to navigate the philosophical and legal tension between ecocentric/bio-centric approaches and Europe’s anthropocentric legal traditions to produce effective environmental outcomes?

**Evidence**: “The Rule of Law for Nature focuses on the well-being of both humans and nature in a symbiotic relationship... modern Western law is merely part of the enclosure of nature... environmental reductionism, manifested by compartmentalisation, fragmentation and anthropocentrism.” (2.2 Rights of Nature in legal philosophy)
“By now... I concur with those legal scholars who do not share the view that RoN entails a shift of paradigm in law... The dichotomy between RoN and modern European environmental law is therefore partly artificial, a symbolic construct.” (5.7 Rights of Nature is not a revolution, but...)

---

### EUONEHEALTH24: One Health governance in the European Union

**Question**: How can EU One Health governance move from anthropocentrism toward interdependence in practice while navigating societal norms and ontological shifts?

**Evidence**: “We note an expanding scope and a paradigm shift from the previous anthropocentric framing, while recognising that the conditions for making practical changes are not yet able to accommodate these... The definition allows for us to be strategic... away from anthropocentrism and towards ecological health.” (One Health definition – Summary)
“Interdependence... implies ecological egalitarianism... may be difficult to put into practice as it conflicts with conventional anthropocentric ethical beliefs... We recognise that sometimes it will be more realistic to emphasise interconnection rather than interdependence...” (One Health definition – 'Closely linked' and 'interdependent')

---

### TNBEYOND24: Analysing the beyond growth debate

**Question**: How can Western policy frameworks integrate pluriversal, Indigenous worldviews (e.g., Buen Vivir) without semantic appropriation or extractivism of knowledge?

**Evidence**: “The adaptation of indigenous buen vivir visions in national policies in South-America risks becoming top-down... and uniform... Kothari et al. (2014) warn for the claim that policies mirror indigenous notions of wellbeing when they in fact do not.” (A.7.4 Text box A7)
“Is the take-away from buen vivir that western societies should adopt such vision, or that these societies should refrain from the cultural universalist approach of imposing Western values on other societies?” (A.7.5)

---

### UNTRANS25: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 1. Transformative change and a sustainable world

**Question**: How can transformative change reconcile disparate worldviews and paradigms, including holistic Indigenous perspectives and dominant modernist separations of humans and nature?

**Evidence**: “Destruction of nature has been enabled by a dominant worldview that views humanity as separate from and superior to nature... This worldview is at odds with the holistic perspectives of many Indigenous and relational worldviews... Approaches that dismantle colonial and neocolonial structures and ways of thinking to actively make space for other worldviews, values and knowledge systems are vital for transformation.” (Sections 1.2.2 and 1.3.2)

---

### IPBESTCA4: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 4. Overcoming the challenges of achieving transformative change

**Question**: How do prevailing relations of domination and coloniality in worldviews impede transformative change and marginalize alternative (e.g., Indigenous) epistemologies?

**Evidence**: “The relationship between people and biodiversity is characterized by a prevailing world view marked by a propensity to adopt more rigidly categorical views... This world view reflects forms of modernity shaped by colonialism... which extend into the present as parts of a globalizing formation of modernity/coloniality.” (4.2.1)
“Current scientific systems reflect relations of domination that privilege one way of knowing and living in the world over others... The reliance upon this one way of knowing the world dismisses alternative views and knowledge that might have transformative potential.” (Executive Summary point 9; 4.2.1)

---

### IPBESPATHWAYS19: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 5. Realizing a sustainable world for nature and people: transformative strategies, actions and roles for all

**Question**: How can plural worldviews, including Indigenous and local knowledge, be incorporated into pathways and inner transformations for sustainability?

**Evidence**: 

> Transformation pathways that take diverse worldviews: There are gaps in knowledge about pathways... which take diverse worldviews into account, including Indigenous and local knowledge... Exploring inner transformation... through culturally sensitive and inclusive practices, education, psycho-social practices, facilitation processes...
>
> *(Box 5.3)*



---

### CAGENE23: Framing challenges and opportunities for Canada – Expert panel on regulating gene-edited organisms for pest control

**Question**: How should ethical disagreements about humans ‘playing God’ and intervening in nature be navigated?

**Evidence**: 

> Opinions on whether nature should be edited in this manner will be diverse and potentially polarized, and they may be impossible to resolve... Public perceptions, opinions, and beliefs are value-laden and cannot be responded to solely with scientific information.
>
> *(Chapter 2.3)*



---

### IBPESWILD22: Chapter 2: Conceptualizing the sustainable use of wild species

**Question**: How can differing worldviews (e.g., Indigenous relational ontologies and Western frameworks) be accommodated within conceptualizations and measurement of sustainable use?

**Evidence**: “Indigenous and local worldviews... are encoded in cosmologies... Together they carry key insights to enhance the way people understand the natural world... there are many other pertinent perspectives... The diversity of ways in which sustainability is conceptualized means that there is no ‘one size fits all’ approach to appropriately and effectively characterize, measure and monitor sustainable use.” (2.2.4, Conclusions; 2.3.4)

---

### IPBSVALUES22: Summary for policymakers of the methodological assessment of the diverse values and valuation of nature

**Question**: How can policy and valuation bridge incompatible or diverse world-views (anthropocentric vs bio/ecocentric vs pluricentric)?

**Evidence**: “People perceive, experience and interact with nature in many ways... policymaking largely disregards the multiple ways in which nature matters to people... prioritizes a narrow set of nature’s values.” (KM2) “World-views... Anthropocentric... bio/ecocentric... pluricentric...” (Box SPM 1)

---

### IPBESMODELS46: Report of the IPBES task force on scenarios and models – Nature Futures Scenarios

**Question**: How can diverse value perspectives (e.g., ‘nature for nature’, ‘nature as culture’, ‘nature for society’) be maintained, translated, and negotiated in models that tend to assume a single consensus view?

**Evidence**: “Maintaining diverse value perspectives in modelling: How to translate the value perspectives of the NFF into a conceptualisation that best represents reality?… In modelling, often one consensus view is assumed, which leads to the incorporation of only a single (often western) perspective into the model, and the application of the NFF would require moving beyond this approach.” (II.b)

---

### SIPSECURITY21: Anthropocene (in)securities: reflections on collective survival 50 years after Stockholm

**Question**: How can security doctrines reconcile anthropocentric legacies with post-human, entangled ontologies to enable more-than-human justice and flourishing?

**Evidence**:  

> In a time when our global modes of economy... are disrupting the planet’s life‑upholding systems, dualistic understandings of an active and morally countable human subject and a passive and external nature no longer seem to make analytical or moral sense.
>
> *(Chapter 1 – Anthropocene insecurities)*



---

### NZOCEAN21: The breaking wave: reforming the oceans management system in Aotearoa New Zealand

**Question**: Disparate and sometimes incompatible worldviews and epistemologies between te ao Māori and Western legal/science systems complicate inclusion of mātauranga Māori and nonhuman voices.

**Evidence**: “Te ao Māori and tikanga Māori are not just ‘subjects’ of the oceans management system... They also need to be factors that guide what the system looks like... there can be disagreements as to who is responsible for interpreting what they mean within specific contexts.” (Chapter 1.11)
“metaphysical concepts do not fit well within this objective framework, which depends on the presence of physical facts that can be quantified by science... There is danger in assigning a Pākehā term to a Māori concept.” (Chapter 3.1 Tikanga spotlight; citing difficulties of translation)

---

### EURIGHTS: Towards an EU Charter of the Fundamental Rights of Nature

**Question**: How can EU law shift from an anthropocentric paradigm to an ecocentric worldview in order to empower nonhuman beings?

**Evidence**: “This necessary step will involve the legal recognition of the Rights of Nature on all levels and a shift from a purely anthropocentric worldview to a more ecocentric worldview that sees humanity as one species within a radically interconnected web of life, where the wellbeing of each part is dependent on the wellbeing of the Earth system as a whole.” (Executive Summary, p. 7)

---

### UNBOL2023: Plurinational State of Bolivia position on Nature-Based Solutions – UNEP Consultation

**Question**: How to reconcile and institutionalise epistemological parity between modern science and Indigenous/ancestral sciences in global environmental governance?

**Evidence**: “They prevent and hinder the recognition of the epistemological parity between modern sciences and knowledge and the sciences and knowledge of Indigenous Peoples by trying to homogenize and simplify what is clearly part of a plurality of knowledge and values.” (p.3)
“d) Facilitate epistemological parity between modern science and ancestral science of Indigenous Peoples world, strengthening the interscientific dialogue between them.” (Annex)

---

### GOVUK22: What is environmental degradation, what are its causes, and how to respond?

**Question**: Conflicting narratives (Malthusian scarcity, ecomodernism, inequality, care, anti-capitalist) complicate shared definitions of degradation and restoration.

**Evidence**: “Five explanations of the root causes of environmental degradation widely applied in policy debates and promoted by different actors are identified... Each suggests a very different interpretation of causes and effects with contrasting implications for research design, policy, and practice.” (1. Introduction)
“Clearly each of these narratives is an ‘ideal type’... however, each narrative is centred on a particular social, political, and economic framing... Acknowledging these different framings and the power associated with each is therefore crucial...” (4.5 Narrative synthesis)

---

### UNESCOEDU20: Learning to become with the world: education for future survival

**Question**: How can education extract itself from entrenched humanist dualisms and human exceptionalism to adopt pluriversal, cosmopolitical, more-than-human worldviews?

**Evidence**: “We have finally discarded the Cartesian dualisms that structured the unswerving humanist belief that our supreme rationality and the exclusivity of our intentional agency set us apart from, and above, the rest of the living world... In short, we have undone the Euro-Western human-centric stranglehold on education.” (Visionary declarations, 1)

---

### UNGEOETHICS22: Concept note of the World Commission on the Ethics of Scientific Knowledge and Technology (COMEST) on the ethics of climate engineering

**Question**: How can intercultural ethical frameworks (Ubuntu, Indigenous, Christian stewardship, Confucian harmony, feminist perspectives) be integrated into a coherent, globally legitimate ethics for climate engineering?

**Evidence**: “Given the global character... an intercultural ethical perspective is needed... the dimensions and approaches to take into account include: the time dimension: Ubuntu perspectives... the space dimension: Indigenous perspectives... the care dimension: Christian perspectives... harmony: Confucian perspectives... gender: A feminist perspective.” (III. Intercultural ethical perspectives)

---

### COMESTWATER22: Report of COMEST on water ethics: ocean, freshwater and coastal areas

**Question**: How can policy move from anthropocentric to ecocentric ethics across diverse cultural and legal contexts?

**Evidence**: “This requires a shift from an anthropocentric approach to a more ecocentric approach based in part on principles of equity while recognizing cultural and ecosystem diversity.” (Executive Summary, 2)
“A holistic approach calls for human beings to recognise… the dependency of other living beings on water systems.” (Introductory Remarks, 4)

---

### UNSECURITY24: Envisioning security for a more-than-human world

**Question**: How can we transcend anthropocentric conceptualizations of security and build a conjoined human–environmental security for a more-than-human planet?

**Evidence**: “Post-COVID-19, we must project a sense of security for a more-than-human planet... transcending anthropocentric conceptualizations of security is key and necessitates carefully documenting the planet’s intersecting human and environmental precarities.” (Extending the human security concept)

---

### UNESCOBIO11: Ethics and biodiversity

**Question**: How can conflicting worldviews (anthropocentric, biocentric, ecocentric, cosmocentric) be reconciled in biodiversity governance?

**Evidence**: “COMEST (2010) identified points on spectrums that dialectically mapped represent seemingly un-synthesizable points or parallax gaps... The inability to solve each of the respective issues with singular universally satisfactory synthesises represents the basis for considering another approach to international environmental policy.” (2.14 Ethical Options for the Future)

---

### EUANTHRO: Exiting the Anthropocene? Exploring fundamental change in our relationship with nature

**Question**: How to move from anthropocentric ‘us and them’ mindsets to relational ‘all of us’ paradigms that are politically legitimate and operational?

**Evidence**: “Even well-intended policies are often based on the divide between ‘us’, humans, and ‘them’, the other species. This thinking is intrinsically at the core of the Anthropocene and needs to be rethought.” (Key messages)
“Governance itself has to become not only wise... but truly participatory, symbiotic and tentacular. Our societies would need to be governed in a way that aligns with the needs and concerns of those who are currently ‘left behind’, humans and non-humans...” (p.14)

---

### D4C25: Design for Environmental Conservation (Toolkit)

**Question**: How can conservation shift from Dominant Social Paradigms (colonial, technocratic, growth-centric) to pluriversal, multispecies, decolonial approaches?

**Evidence**: “Dominant Social Paradigms, rooted in colonial, patriarchal, and technocratic worldviews… Decolonizing conservation involves shifting away from these… Arturo Escobar’s ‘pluriversal thinking’ concept provides a valuable framework.” (Ch.2)
“Technocracy… has become another dangerous mindset that has created complacency… We cannot solve problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.” (Ch.4)

---

### IUCNWILD16: Wilderness protected areas: management guidelines for IUCN Category 1b protected areas

**Question**: Diverse and sometimes conflicting worldviews about wilderness create barriers to inclusive, effective management.

**Evidence**: “A discussion of the term wilderness is incomplete without acknowledging that the term attracts controversy and criticism... Some Indigenous Peoples resist using the term wilderness... post-modern... suggestion that there is no such thing as wilderness... wilderness is simply a ‘lost cause’.” (1.1 Critiques of wilderness)
