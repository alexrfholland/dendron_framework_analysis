### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### UNESCOBIO11: Ethics and biodiversity

- **Organisation**: UNESCO
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because Deep Ecology is explicitly and substantively discussed, including Naess’ core principles and movement-level implications, but it is not turned into concrete policy instruments or institutionalized mechanisms within the report; the engagement remains explanatory and critical rather than a detailed, implementable framework for governance.

- Context/synthesis: The text differentiates deep ecology from shallow ecology and lists Naess’ core points that include intrinsic values of nonhumans and policy change, demonstrating a thorough conceptual engagement: 

> In making the distinction of a ‘Deep Ecology’ from a shallow one, a comprehensive list of core principles were crafted... 1. The well-being and flourishing of human and nonhuman life on earth have value in themselves... 5. Present human interference with the nonhuman world is excessive, and the situation is rapidly worsening. 6. Policies must therefore be changed...
>
> *(2.6 Deep Ecology)*


- Context/synthesis: It connects the philosophy to a social movement and practical imperatives (preservation/restoration), but does not develop concrete governance mechanisms within the chapter: 

> In the early stages of Deep Ecology’s development the distinction was made between its philosophy and its existence as a movement... From these core principles certain imperatives can be distilled, that of preservation of un-spoilt wilderness and restoration of degraded wilderness are an example...
>
> *(2.6 Deep Ecology)*


- Context/synthesis: The report covers criticisms and contrasts (e.g., social ecology critique), reinforcing that deep ecology is treated at the level of theory/movement analysis rather than enacted public policy within the report: 

> Some proponents of ‘social ecology’ criticize deep ecology... others criticize the inherent trans-disciplinarian position... The one criticism echoed... is that humans’ place within the approach is not clear.

#### EUANTHRO: Exiting the Anthropocene? Exploring fundamental change in our relationship with nature

- **Organisation**: EEA
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the briefing explicitly presents deep ecology as a conceptual approach to reframe human–nature relations (‘intrinsic value’), but stops short of providing implementation mechanisms.

- Context/synthesis: Deep ecology is introduced among core concepts for rethinking relations and valuing nature’s intrinsic worth: “Humans are deeply interconnected... Concepts such as ‘strong sustainability’, ‘deep ecology’, ‘the Symbiocene’ and ‘the Chthulucene’ illustrate this point and provide inspiration...” (p.1)

- Context/synthesis: It further explains deep ecology’s ethical implications via Næss and ecological self—considering outcomes for behaviour and identity: “The philosopher Arne Næss — one of the founders of deep ecology — was highly influenced by the Indian principle of ahimsa... what Næss called one’s ecological self...” (p.11–12)
