- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because Industry 5.0 is explicitly discussed as a guiding transformation concept and repeatedly cited (including ESIR reports), but it is a human-centred sustainability framework; the usage is conceptual and strategic for R&I and industrial policy without concrete, nonhuman-empowering mechanisms (and thus fits shallow paternalism).

- The analysis positions Industry 5.0 as a needed shift to integrate societal dimensions in industrial transitions: 

> Finally, experts have advised the EU to support the transition of its industrial systems from a digital industry 4.0 to a transformative industry 5.0, one able to innovate and contribute to the twin transition while ensuring a fair transition, and full integration of the social and societal dimension, maintaining a social and societal dimension, which is crucial to ensure that the transition is just, effective and leaves no one behind.

- It references foundational ESIR outputs framing Industry 5.0 as governance of systemic transformations: 

> European Commission, ESIR (2022), Industry 5.0: A transformative vision for Europe – Governing systemic transformations towards a sustainable industry.
>
> *(Section 3.1 references)*


- The document links Industry 5.0 to broader policy (e.g., Green Deal Industrial Plan) and skills, but remains focused on human-centred benefits, productivity and competitiveness rather than nonhuman empowerment. (Sections 3.2.6; 3.3.2)

- No operational mechanisms are provided that would incorporate nonhuman decision-making; hence it remains a conceptual orientation under shallow paternalism.
