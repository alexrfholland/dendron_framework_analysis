## Score 4: Actionable Mechanisms

*No sources at this score level*

## Score 3: Core Conceptual Device / Implications Explored

### IMPLEMENTATION AND METRICS

#### IUCNWILD16: Wilderness protected areas: management guidelines for IUCN Category 1b protected areas

- **Organisation**: IUCN
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Applied/Practice-Based

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because rewilding is treated as a core conceptual and management framework for more-than-human empowerment, with detailed implications, examples, and guidance (definitions, options, cases) explored across ethical, scientific, technical, and policy contexts; however, it stops short of prescribing a single, uniform policy mechanism. - The text defines rewilding and differentiates applications, linking to wilderness goals (empowering ecological agency and processes): 

> Rewilding has come into common use more recently than the other terms... ‘rewilding is a type of large-scale biological and ecological restoration that emphasizes recovery of wide-ranging native species, top carnivores, and other keystone species... to regain functional and resilient ecosystems’ (Noss, 1992).
>
> *(4.7)*

 - It develops implications for practice (what, where, how much, baselines, goals) and presents concrete cases (Europe, UK, India) illustrating how rewilding restores autonomy of nonhuman ecosystems: 

> In Europe... up to 30 million hectares of land [are] in various stages of natural rewilding... Rewilding Europe... rewilding at least 1 million hectares... generating new natural solutions... species reintroductions... and classic wilderness management.
>
> *(4.7 Rewilding in Europe)*

 - It discusses operational choices (connectivity, fire, hydrology, alien species, disease, species relocation) as outcome-oriented strategies, explicitly empowering nonhuman processes: 

> Maintaining connectivity at a landscape scale will allow species to migrate and shift their ranges in response to climate change... The Cores, Corridors and Carnivores (CCC) model...
>
> *(4.7 Connectivity)*

 - It integrates ethical and political dimensions (indigenous knowledge, culture, values) into rewilding governance and management decisions: 

> Where relevant, wilderness decision makers should consult with Indigenous Peoples, drawing on their knowledge and capacity to promote adaptation activities.
>
> *(4.7)*

 - It frames success criteria and trade-offs under uncertainty (adaptive management) showing how rewilding contributes to long-term nonhuman autonomy: 

> Passive management... maintains that the best approach to increase resilience... is through actions such as ensuring that wilderness is protected from human impacts... and ensuring that core areas are connected...
>
> *(4.7 Passive Management)*

### SCENARIOS AND FUTURES EXPLORATION

#### NEHALF20: Narratives for the Half Earth and Sharing the Planet scenarios

- **Organisation**: PBL
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because rewilding is used across both scenarios as a conceptual and practical restoration device with discussed implications and trade-offs (e.g., integrating with mosaic landscapes vs strict separation), but the report does not itself set a detailed step-by-step rewilding program. 

- As HE instrument: “To achieve the 50% target, some areas will require rewilding and ecological restoration of now degraded lands... connectivity is dealt with indirectly when addressing fragmentation of patches.” (6.1.3)

- SP perspective and critique/implications: “Büscher and Fletcher... are critical... ‘rewilded spaces are “man-made to be wild”’... Notwithstanding this critique, they... espouse rewilding as ‘ecological restoration to promote self-regulating, biodiverse ecosystems’ in mosaic landscapes.” (5.1.5)

- Integration choices and consequences: “These differences... have important implications... basis of the difference in conservation strategies between the HE and SP scenarios.” (3.3)

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### ADELPLAN21: Green Adeliade Regional Landscape Plan 2021—26. Pathway to a Cooler, Greener, Wilder and Climate-Resilient Adelaide

- **Organisation**: Department for Environment and Water and State of South Australia
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the plan adopts rewilding as a strategic direction for urban landscapes, identifies key opportunities and defines it in terms of restoring biodiversity and natural processes, demonstrating conceptual commitment and initial pathways, though without a fully detailed implementation program in this document.

- The plan elevates rewilding as an iconic program to deliver with partners: “Rewilding our urban landscapes… We will lead rewilding efforts by transforming green spaces into thriving ecosystems suitable for threatened and iconic species and biodiverse places for people to enjoy and connect with nature. Key opportunities include: Field River Valley, Dry Creek, platypus reintroduction scoping study, enhancing threatened butterfly habitat, urban raptors, Aldinga Washpool, Sturt River and Mutton Cove.” (Partnerships to deliver iconic programs)

- It defines rewilding in a way that centers nonhuman needs and ecological agency: “Rewilding means aiming efforts to restore and protect the biodiversity and natural processes of an area (i.e. the interactions among plants, animals and the environment which help create and shape an area).” (Partnerships to deliver iconic programs)

- The plan links rewilding to multi-stakeholder delivery and complementary priorities (e.g., rivers to sea corridors, coastal and marine habitats), indicating broader governance implications: “We will work with Kaurna, all levels of government, industry, private landholders and communities to deliver across our seven priorities.” (Partnerships to deliver iconic programs)

## Score 2: Theoretical Treatment

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### UNLAND17_2: The Global Land Outlook: Part 2 - The Outlook

- **Organisation**: UNCCD
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the document explicitly discusses re-wilding as a restoration strategy (with examples and social considerations), but treats it as a potential approach subject to context and controversy rather than a codified management program with agreed targets or implementation protocols.

- Defines re-wilding and presents it as an option for abandoned lands, while acknowledging socio-ecological trade-offs: 

> One option is to allow these abandoned lands to ‘re-wild’ by passively assisting the natural regeneration of forests and other natural habitats, gradually removing human control and influence. Abandonment is not confined to the richer countries: over 360,000 km2 of abandoned lands in Latin America and the Caribbean were naturally reforested between 2001 and 2010. Re-wilding is not without controversy. European agricultural landscapes hold important cultural and historical values and wild landscapes are resisted by some people in part due to their link with increases in large carnivore populations.
>
> *(Chapter 9, Restoration)*


- Rewilding is embedded in a broader multi-functional landscape planning framework rather than detailed as a stand-alone plan: 

> A balanced approach to landscape planning, which includes re-wilded land as a part of multi-functional agricultural landscapes, will supply multiple ecosystem services and more likely be accepted by society.
>
> *(Chapter 9, Restoration)*

#### EIVIS23: Exploring new visions for a sustainable bioeconomy

- **Organisation**: JRC, EC
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because rewilding is substantively advocated in the agriculture and land-use discussion (freeing land via precision fermentation) to restore wild ecosystems, but concrete rewilding governance programs are not laid out. - Context/synthesis: The report makes a strong case for freeing land from livestock to allow ecological restoration and carbon drawdown—classic rewilding outcomes. 

> If we were to obtain our protein this way... we could rewild vast tracts of the world, drawing down much of the carbon that's already been released... and allowing ecosystems to return.
>
> *(p. 33)*


- Context/synthesis: It articulates the ecological opportunity costs of grazing, arguing for prioritizing wild ecosystems over pasture. 

> Because pastures occupy so much land, they have enormous ecological and carbon opportunity costs... The great majority of the world's species depend on wild ecosystems...
>
> *(p. 32)*


- Context/synthesis: While calling for policy change (ending perverse CAP incentives), the text does not provide detailed rewilding policy instruments.

## Score 1: Token Acknowledgement

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### IPBESTCA2: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 2. Visions of a sustainable world – for nature and people

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because rewilding is cited as a social movement/initiative among inspiring cases, but not elaborated within this chapter’s analysis.

- Rewilding is listed among social movement visions: 

> Social Movements • WEAll (Wellbeing Economy Alliance) • H.E.A.R.T energy achieving real transformation • Rewilding Earth/Europe • Pachamama*
>
> *(Table 2.3)*


- Prevents higher score: the chapter does not discuss rewilding mechanisms or outcomes.
