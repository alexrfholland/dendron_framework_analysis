# Reframe stakeholders to include ecosystems, species, and technologies

## Score 4: Actionable Mechanisms

### IMPLEMENTATION AND METRICS

#### D4C25: Design for Environmental Conservation (Toolkit)

- **Organisation**: None
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Design/Engineering

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because the toolkit operationalizes stakeholder reframing to include species and ecosystems via specific canvases, process steps, and governance roles (advocates), and shows applications in cases (e.g., Sea Gardens). 

- Method to reframe stakeholders: “Stakeholder Characterization… define your key stakeholders… Human Personas… Non-Human Personas… Organizational personas… Because these personas will not have a voice, team members and specialists can be their advocates.” (Ch.7)

- System-level inclusion: “Contextual System Map… Stakeholders: people, organizations, or even non-human elements… Connections: flows include information, labor, materials, energy, or money.” (Ch.10)

- Decision-making and negotiation support: “Stakeholder Motivation Matrix… helps teams understand and visualize why different people and organizations (stakeholders) would want to be involved… to create influence groups… align stakeholders around shared goals.” (Ch.10)

- Evidence of outcomes/indicators: “Sea Gardens… artificial reef structures… partnerships with Maaori artists… Interactive information boards… ecological monitoring (mussel growth, water clarity)… Impact Planning aligned with SDGs.” (Ch.8–10)

#### DBIO23: Integrating biodiversity in urban development

- **Organisation**: None
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because the paper proposes biodiversity explicitly as 'non-human stakeholders' and 'citizens', introduces a 'participatory ladder for non-humans', and provides designers with processes, frameworks, and tools (e.g., species selection, assessments, modelling, indices) to actively include nonhuman stakeholders in design decision-making. 

- Foundational reframing: “We propose that acknowledging the ‘non-human’ stakeholder role of biodiversity is a critical first step towards proactive choices that enable ‘biodiversity inclusive design’. This will enable designers to expand user-centred design for a more nuanced understanding of both human and non-human needs.” (Abstract)

- Practice mechanism—participation ladder: “We present an emergent ‘participatory ladder for non-humans’, which encourages designers to elevate biodiversity to having an active stakeholder role, leading towards biodiversity inclusive design practice.” (Abstract)

- Actionable approaches and tools: The review “identified fourteen design frameworks – or structured design methodologies – that enable more active participation for biodiversity within the design process,” and “Fifty-four publications supplied practical methods, or tools... biodiversity assessments... ecological modelling... least-cost modelling... building information systems... indices (e.g., City Biodiversity Index).” (3; 2.3.2; 3.2)

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### DWILD20: Designing wildlife-inclusive cities

- **Organisation**: None
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because the concept explicitly reframes stakeholders to include wildlife as explicit design subjects (target species) and sets governance for human stakeholders to co-decide species and habitat integration, with monitoring and feedback loops. 

- Stakeholder involvement as core: “stakeholder involvement and participatory approaches” are defined as a key feature of successful projects; case studies include “workshop with tenants,” “cooperation with local authorities, business and residents.” (Abstract; Table 2)

- Wildlife as stakeholders through target species: “wildlife is regarded as an opportunity that offered new perspectives on the architecture of buildings and landscape design… buildings were regarded as rocks or cliffs for birds and porosity and spaces for shelter/nests were integrated into the structure.” (3.1)

- Governance and negotiation: “participatory approaches addressed those who may have had no formal power… different opinions… potential for conflict… long-term education and natural history projects may be means to reduce fears.” (3.1)

- Outcomes/criteria: “post-occupancy monitoring and evaluation… shared with stakeholders… best-practice guides can be produced to disseminate results.” (3.1)

#### EUECOSERVG2021: Ecosystem services accounting – part III

- **Organisation**: JRC, EC
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because the report operationally reframes stakeholders in ecosystem accounting to include ecosystems as demand-side users, polluters as enabling users of sink services, and introduces ‘global society’ as a formal user in supply–use tables—providing concrete, actionable accounting mechanisms and tables for implementation.

- Foundational reframing: ecosystems as users (ecological demand) and enabling actors as users of sink services are proposed and embedded in methods and accounting allocation: 

> However, ecosystems also need ESs to maintain their condition and, although this is often neglected, ecosystems can be identified as users of ESs. This can be defined as the ecosystem demand for ESs. ... The example provided in this report to illustrate the importance of the ecological demand is soil retention.
>
> *(Chapter 2.3.1)*


- Concrete allocation rule for sink services: polluters-as-users aligned with polluter pays, with regulatory justification and implications for allocation: 

> Traditionally, assessments allocated sink ESs to the downstream beneficiaries. However, we support the allocation of sink ESs to the polluters, who are the enabling actors of the service... The existence of a regulatory framework provides the conceptual context to justify the allocation of sink ESs to polluters (Figure 5).
>
> *(Chapter 2.3.2 and Chapter 5.1)*


- Institutional innovation: adding ‘global society’ as an explicit user for global public goods (climate and biodiversity), and providing mechanisms (actual vs missed flow) and use tables: 

> In the use tables, we name this specific category of users ‘global society’. Including global society in use tables is a unique feature of the INCA project compared with SEEA EA, in which this kind of flow is attributed to ‘government’. ... The interaction between ES potential flow and global society can generate ES actual flow and ES missed flow.
>
> *(Chapter 2.2)*


- Consequences and negotiation strategies via indicators/goals: concrete accounting outputs quantify actual and missed flows and inform policy targets (e.g., restoration needs, sustainability): 

> The missed ES monetary flow is that which people would be willing to pay if more ecosystem features (suitable habitats and species hotspots) were available... This assessment implies that there is significant room to restore ecosystems to improve ecological condition and enhance biodiversity.
>
> *(Chapter 3.5.4)*


- Technical implementation across ethical/conceptual, empirical, technical, and policy layers: supply–use tables define new users (global society, polluters), methods derive ecological demand (soil retention) and thresholds (water purification), with explicit tables and indicators: 

> SUTs report ES actual flow, which represents the transaction between ecosystem type and economic units... Those services where ES D can be linked to a specific territory may be defined as ‘domestic ESs’... nevertheless, there are some ESs whose users are not represented by a specific sector in a specific country... we name this specific category of users ‘global society’.
>
> *(Chapter 2.2)*


- Concrete mechanism examples: (a) Soil retention SUTs with ecosystems as users and agriculture as monetary user; (b) Water purification SUTs allocating flows to polluters; (c) Habitat/species maintenance use tables allocating to global society. 

> In monetary terms, the SUTs only address the transaction between ecosystem type and economic unit... the only flow that is reported estimates the transaction between ‘cropland’ and the ‘primary sector’; all the other intra-ecosystem flows are not reported.

; 

> The case of water purification ... shows that the flow of this service in the use table is allocated to the agricultural sector

; 

> With habitat and species maintenance, Europe provides a service to the global society (Table 3.11).
>
> *(Chapters 4.3; 2.3.2; 3.5.4)*

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### EURIGHTS: Towards an EU Charter of the Fundamental Rights of Nature

- **Organisation**: EESC
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because the Charter explicitly reframes Nature as a primary stakeholder in EU governance and proposes concrete institutional mechanisms to institutionalize nonhuman participation (legal personality, Ombudsman/Amicus Naturae, standing, integration across all policies).

- Nature explicitly reframed as stakeholder in governance with legal hooks: 

> This brings Nature into our legal, political, social and economic decision‑making as a 'stakeholder' in its own right whose rights must be respected and integrated into all our actions.
>
> *(Section 5.3, p. 62-63)*


- Concrete mechanisms for representation/participation: 

> The participation rights introduced by the Aarhus Convention... The introduction of the Rights of Nature in the deliberative processes could favour a different public participation... it would be 'proactive', if a provision such as art. 71 of the Constitution of Ecuador; it would operate according to the protection of Nature through the rules indicated above... include Ombudsman empowerment to promptly investigate any serious environmentally related Rights of Nature infringements... 'Amicus Naturae' of the EU.
>
> *(Section 5.6.4, p. 82-85; Section 4.4, Milestone 6, p. 55)*


- Integration across all EU policies: 

> The 3 elements of the ecological mandate are... the introduction of the obligation to take into consideration the Rights of Nature in all policies, and not only in the decisions of the courts.
>
> *(Executive Summary, p. 7)*


- Outcomes/criteria for success tied to stakeholder reframing: 

> Overcoming the current fragmented approach, by providing an overarching context for our existence as part of the Earth as a whole... Empowering people to pro‑actively reject governmental actions which permit unwanted and damaging development, by enabling people to assert the rights of those ecosystems...
>
> *(Section 4.1, p. 50-51)*

## Score 3: Core Conceptual Device / Implications Explored

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### UNPLANETBOUND22: Thematic study: planetary boundaries

- **Organisation**: UNDRR
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the document explicitly calls for governance that includes “more-than-humans” as interests and proposes reframing humans as integral components of the Earth system, with implications for representation and inclusion in systemic risk governance. - It explicitly extends stakeholder inclusion: 

> Work with national government to ensure that systemic risk governance actively promotes resilience by... Empowering and including those interests that have traditionally been excluded (i.e. ‘all State and non-State interests including those in the global North and the global South, of present and future generations, and of humans and more-than-humans’).
>
> *(Part 2.3.2, Priority for Action 2, Message 2.5)*

 - It reframes humans within the stakeholder set of Earth systems: 

> Recast human societies as an integral, interacting component of a complex, adaptive Earth System and as an indispensable ally in collective, planetary well-being and health... Transforming our relationship with nature... in the Anthropocene biosphere, society must be viewed as part of the biosphere, not separate from it.
>
> *(Part 1.5 / Part 1.3)*

 - It links inclusion to decision outcomes: 

> Governments and other stakeholders need to integrate planetary boundaries into decision-making processes across and within sectors... Increased coordination and cooperation, not just horizontally across goals, targets and sectors, but vertically across scales and regions.
>
> *(Part 2.3.2, Priority for Action 1, Message 1.4)*

#### UNTRANS25: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 1. Transformative change and a sustainable world

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the chapter makes the inclusion of nonhuman actors explicit and foundational under the principle of pluralism and inclusion, framing governance to include nonhuman stakeholders conceptually and exploring implications, though not laying out institutional procedures. - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> The principle of pluralism and inclusion refers to a commitment to recognizing that a diversity of perspectives is legitimate and important... This principle is about ensuring the inclusion of diverse actors (human and non-human), worldviews, values and knowledge systems in ways that both recognize and respect differences and remain open to ongoing contestation...
>
> *(Section 1.3.2, Pluralism and inclusion)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Approaches that dismantle colonial and neocolonial structures and ways of thinking to actively make space for other worldviews, values and knowledge systems are vital for transformation.
>
> *(Section 1.3.2)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Respectful and reciprocal human-nature relationships... creates conditions to recognize the liveliness of a world in which non-human entities also have agency. This highlights the possibility of relating to beings other than humans as subjects and kin...
>
> *(Section 1.3.2)*

#### IPBESPATHWAYS19: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 5. Realizing a sustainable world for nature and people: transformative strategies, actions and roles for all

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the chapter explicitly calls for inclusive governance that incorporates ‘silent voices and non-human perspectives’ and links that inclusion to concrete governance processes (participation, representation, accountability), outcomes (responsibility to act), and mechanisms (councils, co-management, citizen science), thus conceptually empowering nonhumans via representation even if not detailing the exact proxy tools.

- Explicit inclusion of nonhuman perspectives as stakeholders in governance: 

> Inclusive biodiversity governance involves strategies... designed to engage a broad range of stakeholders that represent a plurality of views, structures and practices based on plural knowledge systems, including Indigenous and local knowledge, silent voices and non-human perspectives.
>
> *(5.6.2)*


- Articulation of mechanisms that enact this inclusion and produce outcomes: 

> Examples of mechanisms... include public consultations, deliberative democracy, multi-stakeholder partnerships... co-management of nature, gender-sensitive approaches, biodiversity councils and committees, citizen science programmes and rights-based approaches...
>
> *(5.6.2)*


- The chapter links inclusion to evaluation, accountability, and responsibility: 

> Genuine public participation... provide opportunities for society to pivot...

 and 

> Transparent and inclusive review processes enable all actor groups to genuinely participate in evaluation processes and foster mutual learning.
>
> *(Exec. summary 8–9)*

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### UNBOL2023: Plurinational State of Bolivia position on Nature-Based Solutions – UNEP Consultation

- **Organisation**: UNEP
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the text mandates reframing the stakeholder set—legally recognising Mother Earth as a subject of rights and consolidating ‘communities of life’—and works through implications in policy, law, and education, albeit without a full institutional design template.

- Context/synthesis: The legal recognition shifts the stakeholder boundary decisively beyond humans: 

> a) Recognize Mother Earth as a living being and subject of rights (Rights of Mother Earth).
>
> *(Annex)*


- Context/synthesis: It extends stakeholder inclusion into epistemic governance (epistemological parity) and societal roles, mapping practical implications for decision-making and implementation: 

> d) Facilitate epistemological parity between modern science and ancestral science of Indigenous Peoples world, strengthening the interscientific dialogue between them.
>
> *(Annex)*

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### UNESCOOCEAN24: Ocean decade vision 2030 – Challenge 10

- **Organisation**: UNESCO IOC
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the Ocean Decade paper systematically reframes stakeholders (users) to include the ocean as a rights-bearing living ecosystem, alongside Indigenous governance and multi-knowledge systems, and derives concrete actions (datasets, surveys, training, DCO theory of change). - Context/synthesis: Stakeholders/users include ILK holders, the ocean communications/education communities, and explicitly center the ocean as a living system with its own interests. 

> Existing relationships with the ocean are varied... The singular, shared global ocean is not a separate entity, but an indispensable extension of ourselves and society... recognizing the ocean as a living ecosystem, with its own rights, is imperative.
>
> *(p. 8-9)*


- Context/synthesis: It develops drivers with actionable outputs to proxy nonhuman stakes (values datasets, survey instruments, curriculum, cultural best practices, behaviour change baselines). 

> Success will also depend on the generation, sharing, and use of the following priority datasets: human-ocean connection/human-ocean values dataset(s)... impact mapping... ocean culture mapping...
>
> *(p. 7)*


- Context/synthesis: It articulates structured milestones and indicators to embed these reframings into Decade operations. 

> Indicator 3.1: Behaviour Change Baselines... global ocean literacy survey instrument (i.e., Ocean & Society Survey)... Indicator 4.1: Co-design, Co-development, and Co-production... require evidence of transdisciplinary approaches.
>
> *(p. 20)*

#### UNCITIES21: Global environment outlook for cities – towards green and just cities (GEO for Cities)

- **Organisation**: UNEP & UN-Habitat
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the report reframes urban stakeholders to include nonhumans and ecosystems (rights to the city, governance voice), and translates that reframing into planning and decision processes (biodiversity plans, disaster preparedness, buffers), although it allows for multiple implementation modalities.

- Stakeholder reframing: 

> Lastly, picture a city that recognizes and values its multispecies character... a city where 'those who control and plan cities [...] consider the more-than-human'... This may require exploring ways to give a voice in governance to non-humans.
>
> *(Chapter 4, 4.2.3)*


- Decision-making consequences: The reframing leads to inclusive planning instruments (e.g., corridors, precautionary zones for species, multispecies disaster plans) and informs infrastructure choices. (Chapter 4, 4.2.3)

- Institutional context: Rights of Nature examples (Ecuador, Bolivia, Mexico City) show how formal frameworks can legitimize nonhuman stakeholders. (Chapter 4, 4.2.3)

---

#### SCTRANSS25: Environment strategy for Scotland – transformative changes for sustainability

- **Organisation**: Scottish Government
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the report actively reframes stakeholders to include nonhumans and proposes mechanisms (deliberative processes, political positions, embassy of the North Sea) to institutionalise this reframing, clarifying implications for decision-making processes and outcomes.

- It calls for participatory and democratic processes that explicitly include nonhuman interests, not only human communities: 

> Micro-democracy initiatives... represent non-human interests in participatory decision-making processes.
>
> *(Table 3: Political Instruments)*


- It proposes creating positions and institutions mandated to represent nonhuman stakeholders: 

> Create sustainable future political position(s) that represents future generations, including non-human nature and more than human worlds.
>
> *(Table 3: Radical and speculative future-making)*


- It provides an institutional exemplar that reshapes stakeholder fora to include nonhumans as interlocutors: 

> Embassy of the North Sea... developing a public space in which humans can communicate with non-humans on an equal basis... create new politics of representation.
>
> *(7.3 – Box 8)*


- It connects the reframing to metrics and evaluation (nonhuman wellbeing indicators) and negotiation spaces, setting criteria and goals for success: 

> Promote assessment of wellbeing (human, non-human) in national indicators...
>
> *(Table 3: Economic levers)*

## Score 2: Theoretical Treatment

### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### UNESCOBIO11: Ethics and biodiversity

- **Organisation**: UNESCO
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report explicitly treats nonhuman beings and ecosystems as stakeholders in biodiversity governance, discussing their roles and how stakeholder processes should include them; however, it stops short of prescribing detailed institutional stakeholder procedures that would formally seat nonhumans or their proxies in decision-making bodies.

- Context/synthesis: The report’s stakeholder section explicitly lists nonhuman beings and ecosystems among stakeholders, reframing participation beyond humans: 

> Thus there are a variety of stakeholders of biodiversity including humans, plants, wildlife and other non-human living organisms. In human market behaviour the consumers and producers affect the decline in biodiversity.
>
> *(2.12 Stakeholders)*


- Context/synthesis: It links CBD stakeholder guidance to inclusive planning processes, indicating that stakeholder processes must integrate local/community and ecological knowledge, without prescribing specific procedural designs: 

> Emphasizing the importance of a broad range of stakeholders... CBD... suggests all levels of stakeholders should be include in an across-the-board active way to ensure success... ‘No small group of official or expert ‘biodiversity planners’ will ever have the understanding... without the input of real life experience from local stakeholders...’
>
> *(2.12 Stakeholders)*


- Context/synthesis: The text discusses how different ethical approaches (biocentric/ecocentric) change stakeholder prioritization (e.g., sentient animals vs. plants; pest species), showing implications but not formalized methods: 

> In order to protect biodiversity an ecocentric approach will be generally most useful, which may justify the removal or killing of introduced animals to an ecosystem... A biocentric approach would protect sentient animals over plants...
>
> *(2.12 Stakeholders)*

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### EIVIS23: Exploring new visions for a sustainable bioeconomy

- **Organisation**: JRC, EC
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report explicitly expands the moral and governance community to include other-than-human beings and ecosystems, and proposes monitoring and governance implications, but does not set out specific stakeholder institutional seats. - Context/synthesis: The new vision broadens the moral community to nonhumans, implying stakeholder reframing. 

> The vision has an inclusive perspective, whereby the moral community includes humans as well as other-than-humans, leading to a moral reckoning of the place of humans in the web of life.
>
> *(p. 40)*


- Context/synthesis: In governance implications, the report calls for recognizing nature’s value beyond commodities and for public access to nature—indicative of more-than-human interests in decision-making. 

> Nature’s value and Sustainability hierarchy... some things cannot be substituted with other things or with money... A green and just bioeconomy would thus adopt a new definition of sustainability which establishes a clear hierarchy of priorities...
>
> *(p. 43)*


- Context/synthesis: It suggests adding justice indicators and qualitative assessments in the monitoring system that could proxy nonhuman stakeholder outcomes. 

> An issue... many of the aspects in this new objective are either hard to quantify... It will be important therefore to consider whether these issues are best tackled... as a separate qualitative exercise, where less tangible issues can be captured.
>
> *(p. 42)*

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### NZOCEAN21: The breaking wave: reforming the oceans management system in Aotearoa New Zealand

- **Organisation**: Environmental Defence Society
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report argues for including te moana and ecosystems as actors (ancestors with interests), and proposes representational institutions, but without a formal, systematic stakeholder reframing framework specified. 

- Nonhuman as stakeholders with interests: 

> Te moana (through deities) is an ancestor, linked through oral tradition and whakapapa (kinship) to the people that use and protect it... Te moana has intrinsic value, not just instrumental value.
>
> *(Chapters 2.2, 2.5)*


- Practical stakeholder reframing via representation: 

> An Oceans Commission... could even be a vehicle through which te moana is given legal personhood (with the Commission being the voice of te moana).
>
> *(Chapter 7.3)*


- Policy guidance: 

> Te ao Māori and tikanga Māori are not just 'subjects'... They also need to be factors that guide what the system looks like and the design choices made across all themes.
>
> *(Chapter 1.11)*

### SCENARIOS AND FUTURES EXPLORATION

#### PBLNATUREPOS22: Exploring nature-positive pathways: contribution to CBD Post-2020 GBF

- **Organisation**: PBL Netherlands EA
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report advances 'whole-of-society' and 'multiple values of nature' approaches and treats diverse types of nature as part of configuration analyses, but it does not explicitly assign stakeholder status or agency to nonhumans in governance.

- Whole-of-society with multiple values of nature: “This report suggests that the nature-positive objective is coupled to a framework that considers the multiple ways in which people value and depend on nature… Nature-positive development can only truly be positive when it works for both nature and people.” (p. 16)

- Configurations integrate 'different types of nature' alongside actors: “three specific configurations… rural landscapes, supply chains, and cities. These configurations are networks where non-state actors and local government authorities are considered together with different types of nature (e.g. agricultural lands, wild areas, urban parks).” (p. 14)

- Policy design to interact with these configurations: “This points to the possibilities for national governments to develop policy strategies aimed at actors in these specific contexts to enable transformative change.” (p. 9)

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### ISCHEALTH21: Urban health and wellbeing in the Anthropocene: interdisciplinary science-action plan 2021–2025

- **Organisation**: ISC/ISUH/IAP
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report reframes the city explicitly as a social-ecological-technological system and broadens ‘health’ to include the health of other living systems, implying a wider stakeholder set; however, it does not create institutional mechanisms for formal representation or decision-making power for nonhumans. - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: The plan frames cities and health in terms that include ecosystems and technological systems as integral actors, which conceptually expands stakeholder definitions: 

> It is also now well recognized that the ‘health of cities’ goes beyond the medical understanding of the health of people living in cities. It is a systemic and interdisciplinary concept which recognizes cities as complex adaptive, social, ecological and technological systems.
>
> *(Section 2.4)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: It emphasizes healthy functioning of ecological systems as necessary for urban decision-making, implying they are stakeholders to be considered: 

> The healthy functioning of ecological, social, economic and political systems refers to the flows of energy, resources and data, needed to sustain the lives of people and the planet... The systems approach developed under the UHWB programme can be used a guide for policy and practice, as well as for science to navigate towards future health on a sustainable planet.
>
> *(Section 1)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: The vision shifts to treating cities as nodes in global networks that process information about the city and its environments (including ecosystems), indicating a systemic stakeholder expansion, albeit without formal representation mechanisms: 

> Cities can be viewed as neurons in globally networked urban planet – hubs in which energy, resources and information about the city and its environments are collected, processed, where knowledge is produced to be tested, implemented into action, the results and impacts of which then re-enter the Data-Knowledge-Action Systems (DAKAS).
