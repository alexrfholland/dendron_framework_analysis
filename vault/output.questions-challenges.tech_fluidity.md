### IPBESTCA4: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 4. Overcoming the challenges of achieving transformative change

**Question**: How should governance keep pace with emergent technologies (e.g., gene editing) whose applications evolve faster than regulation while ensuring inclusive deliberation and ecological safeguards?

**Evidence**: “Gene editing is an emerging new technology with applications evolving faster than regulatory processes… it serves as a prime example of how regulatory challenges around emergent technologies could impede both transformative progress and effective biodiversity governance… There is thus a need for inclusive and transparent deliberations about this technology.” (4.2.5)
