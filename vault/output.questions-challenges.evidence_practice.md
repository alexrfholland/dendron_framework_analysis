---

### SCTRANSS25: Environment strategy for Scotland – transformative changes for sustainability

**Question**: How to translate deep leverage concepts (care, relationality, pluriverse) into sustained policy and practice beyond short-term reforms?

**Evidence**: “Leverage points identified in the literature are often very broad... Much of the value... lies in re-emphasizing the need for deeper values and knowledge changes... There is also a risk of slippage from deep leverage points to a narrower focus on levers... Policy levers can reinforce technocratic approaches...” (3.1 Sustainability sciences)

---

### EUCLIM24: Towards sustainable transformation: research priorities in climate change and biodiversity

**Question**: How can research priorities be translated into policy mixes that avoid trade-offs and realize synergies?

### UNLAND17_2: The Global Land Outlook: Part 2 - The Outlook

**Question**: How can we convert technical know-how (e.g., for sustainable water management) into durable behavior change, incentives, and policy uptake?

**Evidence**: 

> Despite massive demographic and environmental changes, water problems are rooted more in management approaches, business models, outdated policies and practices rather than in physical limitations. The technical basis for sustainable water management is well understood, suggesting that solutions need to be aimed primarily at changing behavior and encouraging a multi‑functional systems approach to water management.
>
> *(Chapter 8, Introduction)*



---

### EIVIS23: Exploring new visions for a sustainable bioeconomy

**Question**: How should the EU Bioeconomy Monitoring System integrate justice and nonhuman wellbeing into indicators and qualitative exercises?

**Evidence**: “While the Bioeconomy Monitoring System in its monitoring component is ultimately a quantitative exercise... It will be important therefore to consider whether these issues are best tackled through inclusion into the quantitative... or rather as a separate qualitative exercise, where less tangible issues can be captured.” (p. 42)

---

### IPBESTCA3: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 3. How transformative change occurs

**Question**: What monitoring frameworks and timelines are needed to evaluate target species outcomes and adjust maintenance and design practices?

**Evidence**: “All of the projects included some form of biodiversity monitoring… social and/or economic monitoring… Defining what constitutes success and the time-frame over which it should be achieved is also an important part of the monitoring process… remedial works accomplished and maintenance practices adjusted.” (3.1; 3.2)

---

### UNLEGAL: Environmental rule of law: tracking progress and charting future directions

**Question**: What mechanisms ensure that recognized environmental rights translate into effective implementation rather than remaining ‘on paper’?

**Evidence**: “Recognition of rights alone is not enough to ensure environmental sustainability… many countries that have adopted environmental provisions in their constitutions continue to struggle with environmental degradation due to lack of adequate legal frameworks, good governance and capacity to implement such rights… To ensure that both substantive and procedural rights have an effect and do not just exist on paper, they must be implemented through legislative frameworks, institutions and judicial decisions.” (Chapter 4, Sections 4.1.2 and 4.4)

---

### UNPLANETBOUND22: Thematic study: planetary boundaries

**Question**: How can we address the limitations of existing models, monitoring networks, and data to quantify complex systemic behavior and support PB-aligned DRR?

**Evidence**: “The planetary boundaries research has also catalysed rigorous exploration... demonstrating a ‘strong demand for improved knowledge and quantification or characterization of complex systemic behaviour’, alongside ‘the limitations of current tools (models, Earth observation products, monitoring networks, and other data)’.” (Part 1.1, The scientific underpinnings)

---

### EUHRPLAN21: Human rights for the planet

**Question**: Can human rights remedies shift from individual restitution toward ecological remediation and restoration when violations stem from environmental harm?

**Evidence**: “Where a violation stems from an environmental harm, could human rights law shift its focus from restoring an individual to restoring the environment? ... In such event, could a human rights mechanism require ecological remediation and restoration as the principal measures of redress?” (Redress – Overview of ECtHR environmental case-law)
“It is crucial that the Court order Comprehensive or Integral Reparations for environmental damages, especially through ecological restoration as a means of rehabilitation and restitution.” (Inter-American approaches – Final Reflections)

---

### EUNATURERIGHTS21: Can nature get it right? Rights of Nature in the European context

**Question**: How to strengthen the role of independent science and judicial competence in environmental decision-making and review across diverse Member State systems?

**Evidence**: “Due to the complexity and interrelatedness of environmental issues it must be ensured that all civil servants, lawyers and decision-makers and judges have adequate training... It is further recommended that the Member States establish specialist environmental courts or tribunals...” (5.6 Nature science and evidence in court)
“these advisory boards may serve as models for how to handle technical and scientific evidence in environmental litigation... it should be possible to set up certain requirements for the experience and qualification of the judges, as well as the availability of expertise in the national court systems.” (5.6 Nature science and evidence in court)

---

### EUONEHEALTH24: One Health governance in the European Union

**Question**: How can monitoring, evaluation and indicators be embedded into EU One Health policy cycles to inform scaling and optimisation?

**Evidence**: “A dearth of investment into and delivery of monitoring and evaluation activities points to the need for future research on evaluation methods and tools specific for the One Health approach.” (EU policies – Conclusion)
“Together, the operationalisation ‘checklist’ and information attainable using the indicators... can lead to an iterative One Health policy cycle that continuously optimises the benefits of One Health implementation.” (Executive summary – Criteria and indicators)

---

### TNBEYOND24: Analysing the beyond growth debate

**Question**: How does the adoption of wellbeing and broader welfare indicators ultimately impact policymaking and outcomes?

**Evidence**: “Wellbeing and broader welfare frameworks are presented as a measurement tool. At the same time, they have impacts on policy making. However, the links between measurements and impacts on policy making are still unclear. Further research questions therefore include: How does the adoption of well-indicators ultimately impact policymaking?” (A.1.5)

---

>
> *(Chapter 4.3)*



---

### IBPESWILD22: Chapter 2: Conceptualizing the sustainable use of wild species

**Question**: How can policy and practice meaningfully use global indicators that have low specificity to attribute changes to particular uses of wild species?

**Evidence**: “The relevant indicators in the Sustainable Development Goals Global Indicator Framework are consistently more sensitive than they are specific... the low specificity means that changes in the indicator values cannot be attributed to comparable changes of any specific practice, posing challenges to identify specific changes to policies, regulations or customary activities to respond to the indicator.” (Executive Summary, point 10)

---

### EUHORIZON23: Horizon Europe strategic plan 2025–2027 analysis

**Question**: How can the EU increase the take-up of R&I results to translate scientific knowledge into ecosystem-positive practice and governance?

**Evidence**: “Despite the EU’s strong scientific system and its leadership in applying open science, the take-up of R&I results remains a challenge... Improving the EU’s ability to translate scientific discoveries into market solutions is a priority... The focus of R&I policies must move beyond knowledge transfer and focus on knowledge valorisation and value creation through multi-actor approaches.” (Section 5 – Considerations; 5.2.1)

---

### IPBSVALUES22: Summary for policymakers of the methodological assessment of the diverse values and valuation of nature

**Question**: Why are valuation results so rarely taken up in policy, and how can this gap be closed?

**Evidence**: “Despite the significant increase in valuation studies over the last 30 years, less than 5 per cent report the uptake of valuation in decision-making.” (KM6) “Documenting the use and impact of valuation knowledge can be improved by iterating studies through the policy cycle.” (KM6)

---

### IPBESMODELS46: Report of the IPBES task force on scenarios and models – Nature Futures Scenarios

**Question**: How can the Nature Futures Framework be operationalized in practice, including case-study pipelines, communities of practice, and timelines linked to IPBES assessments?

**Evidence**: “The task force would be happy to engage with modelling communities regarding the development of case studies that would ground and test the application of the NFF. The case studies would ultimately lead to published papers that could be used by the IPBES assessments… cut-off date for new reference insertions is expected after the second external review in 2023.” (III.B)
“Participants suggested… initiating a community of practice where modelling teams interact and share intermediate outcomes… producing publications on how to use the NFF in different contexts, including visualisations such as a flow chart of possible modelling steps.” (Executive summary)

---

### LANCETFOOD19: Food in the Anthropocene: the EAT–Lancet Commission on healthy diets from sustainable food systems

**Question**: How can science-based planetary and health targets be translated into concrete, enforceable policies and practices across sectors?

**Evidence**: “Clear scientific targets that define healthy diets and sustainable food production are necessary to guide policy makers, businesses, and all food system actors… The goal… is for science to continue refining definitions of global scientific targets… while business and policy makers begin translating these definitions into operational science-based targets for various sectors, regions, and countries.” (Safe operating space for food systems)
“We outline five specific and implementable strategies… Our modelling and analysis shows their effectiveness for achieving a Great Food Transformation.” (Executive summary)

---

---

### PBLCITIES21: Realising the Urban Opportunity: Cities and the Post-2020 Biodiversity Governance

**Question**: What reporting, monitoring and verification systems will allow cities to demonstrate contributions to global biodiversity goals?

**Evidence**: “To be both effective and pragmatic, the GBF needs to include targets that resonate with key urban agendas as well as an enabling approach to monitoring and evaluation… the vast majority of urban monitoring is conducted intermittently and on the basis of self-reporting mechanisms that combine global goals with locally relevant targets.” (Summary; Section 3.1)

---

### GEAURBANGREEN23: Tackling the Climate and Biodiversity Crises in Europe through Urban Greening Plans

**Question**: How can evidence on NbS benefits and biodiversity interdependencies be translated into monitoring, indicators, and practical urban planning?

**Evidence**: - Context/synthesis: The report calls for SMART indicators consistent with EU and international targets to ensure evidence translates into implementation and adaptive management. 

> UGP should include measurable targets and require regular reporting against SMART indicators, consistent and harmonised with related international, European, and national targets... An effective and efficient monitoring mechanism is imperative to make sure that UGP are consistently implemented...
>
> *(Section 5, Recommendation 4)*


- Context/synthesis: It highlights a need for tools assessing and illustrating NbS benefits for decision-makers. 

> Lack of availability and access to scientific evidence on interdependencies between ecosystems, resilience and climate change; need for tools assessing and illustrating NbS benefits, and guidance for UGP.

---

### NZOCEAN21: The breaking wave: reforming the oceans management system in Aotearoa New Zealand

**Question**: Difficulties translating plans and evidence into action; non-statutory plans lack strong implementation pathways.

**Evidence**: “Implementation of the non-statutory marine spatial plan for the Hauraki Gulf has proved challenging... there was no institutional champion for the plan’s implementation as a coherent whole, and no formal process for broader public consultation on its provisions.” (Chapter 5.6 Sea Change spotlight)
“Non-statutory processes rely on strong political leadership... Without a statutory framework... there is a risk that plan provisions will get implemented as an integrated package.” (Chapter 5.6)

---

### EURIGHTS: Towards an EU Charter of the Fundamental Rights of Nature

**Question**: Why has EU environmental law failed to halt ecological deterioration, and how can evidence be translated into effective practice?

**Evidence**: “EU Environmental Law provides a well-developed and well-structured legal system of environmental protection... However, so far it has failed to halt the progressive deterioration of the environmental quality in the European territory... As highlighted in SOER 2020... policies have been more effective in reducing environmental pressures than in protecting biodiversity and ecosystems, and human health and well-being.” (Section 2.2, p. 19-20)

---

### UKHYDRO22: Written evidence (LUE0078) to the Land Use in England Committee inquiry

**Question**: How to ensure policy instruments replace inadequate proxies (simple metrics) with process-based models that represent nonhuman needs?

**Evidence**: “Biodiversity Net Gain... in its current form, Biodiversity Metric 3 does not adequately represent the biodiversity consequences of land-use changes... Capturing the effects of land-use changes requires process-based biodiversity models that simulate how species... use landscapes.” (Q7 Response)

---

### UNESCOAI23: Recommendation on the ethics of artificial intelligence

**Question**: How to implement ethical impact assessments and readiness/monitoring methodologies in diverse national contexts?

---

### GOVUK22: What is environmental degradation, what are its causes, and how to respond?

**Question**: Translating conceptual plurality into collaborative, transdisciplinary action (T-labs, co-construction) that can shift policy and practice.

**Evidence**: “The T‑lab (‘transformation lab’, see Box 1) process is one useful framework for convening such dialogues... building on a long tradition of ‘deliberative inclusive processes’ around environmental issues.” (5. How to respond?)
“‘Forming, storming, norming, and performing’: the project process... collaborative co‑construction must be the starting point, and this requires effective research leadership and facilitation...” (Box 2; Section 5)

---

### UNESCOEDU20: Learning to become with the world: education for future survival

**Question**: How can plural ontologies and cosmopolitics translate into sustained institutional practice and governance?

**Evidence**: “Drawing on the principles of cosmopolitics enabled us to adopt a much broader definition of what it means ‘to belong’... common worlds do not pre-exist their articulations but need to be ‘slowly composed’ in the presence of others, both human and more than human.” (Visionary declarations, 6)

---

### COMESTWATER22: Report of COMEST on water ethics: ocean, freshwater and coastal areas

**Question**: How can holistic ethics (e.g., solidarity, common good, ecocentrism) be translated into concrete enforcement and adaptive management?

**Evidence**: “Despite the existing legislation, enormous problems remain to be solved… Parties shall apply a precautionary approach… appropriate preventative measures are taken when there is reason to believe that wastes… are likely to cause harm even when there is no conclusive evidence.” (II.3 Ocean Governance)
“This report suggests that all countries should apply the basic principles of water ethics guided by relevant norms of international law… A participatory approach should be adopted in policy and decision-making.” (VII Recommendations)

---

### UNSECURITY24: Envisioning security for a more-than-human world

**Question**: How do we replace GDP primacy with integrated indicators (e.g., planetary pressures-adjusted HDI) that better reflect human and nonhuman wellbeing?

**Evidence**: “We must challenge the primacy given to economic development and the fact that gross domestic product remains our principal measure... the ‘planetary pressures-adjusted HDI’... aimed at ‘reimagining the human development journey’...” (Metrics section)

---

### ROMEECO22: Transforming our economies from ego to eco

**Question**: How do we translate awareness-based methods into sustained policy change rather than episodic workshops?

**Evidence**: “These five interventions … would together address all five of the most important leverage points Meadows identified. Building collective capacity in systems learning and systems leadership is probably the most important leverage point.” (p. 13) “Yes, it is possible to build transformational learning spaces at scale… And no, they are not as easily scalable as traditional learning environments are.” (p. 16)

---

### UNESCOBIO11: Ethics and biodiversity

**Question**: How can normative biodiversity ethics be translated into enforceable policy and practice?

**Evidence**: “Normative principles... are the most pertinent to policy. As with any utilitarian theory, the question of delayed gratification is at the forefront... It is notable that pure values are not always implicitly necessary in finding practical solutions... The primary assumption that intrinsic value... must be questioned in the hopes of finding workable solutions...” (3.4 Instrumental Value of Biodiversity; 3.1 Categories of Value)

---

### EUANTHRO: Exiting the Anthropocene? Exploring fundamental change in our relationship with nature

**Question**: How to translate ethical/ontological frames (deep ecology, Symbiocene, Rights of Nature) into enforceable legal and policy architectures in the EU context?

**Evidence**: “Inscribing inviolable rights of nature into law might be a promising strategy... but a mere declaration of such rights is not enough unless it is matched by a concomitant change in political values and practical means of enforcement.” (p.7)

---

### IRELANDAAD22: Southern Regional Assembly 2020 Annual Report

**Question**: How can the region translate policy statements (e.g., embedding BGI and NBS in Development Plans) into on-the-ground design practices that secure habitats and stable populations for nonhuman species?

**Evidence**: “In addition, the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy (RSES) states that BGI and NBS should be a key concept of a local authority’s Development Plan, informing actions and strategy around economic development and placemaking.” (Section 7, Blue Green City)
“Selecting target species for AAD at the beginning of the planning process avoids the conflict between the design of urban green spaces and conservation... aligning species conservation and the planning process, without delay to the planning process and without surprises.” (Section 7, Blue Green City – International Good Practices)

---

### D4C25: Design for Environmental Conservation (Toolkit)
