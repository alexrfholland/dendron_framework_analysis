# More-than-human communities (as the concept of more-than-human communities)

## Score 4: Actionable Mechanisms

*No sources at this score level*

## Score 3: Core Conceptual Device / Implications Explored

### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### UNESCOEDU20: Learning to become with the world: education for future survival

- **Organisation**: Common Worlds/UNESCO
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Humanities/Ethics

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the paper centers “common worlds” as more-than-human communities and elaborates how education should co-compose these communities through situated, collaborative practices and cosmopolitical articulations; it develops goals and indicators (learning with, co-habitation), but lacks concrete institutional governance steps. - More-than-human communities are the baseline for pedagogy: 

> We have resituated the practice of education in common worlds because we no longer differentiate between the social and the environmental, and no longer frame pedagogy as an exclusively human activity.
>
> *(Visionary declarations, 7)*

 - They propose education as co-composition of common worlds with human and nonhuman participants, implying negotiation: 

> Common worlds do not pre-exist their articulations but need to be ‘slowly composed’ in the presence of others, both human and more than human (Latour, 2004, p. 457).
>
> *(Visionary declarations, 6)*

 - They define success as learning with and cohabiting with other beings: 

> We now speak from and think with partial worldly perspectives, embodied visions, and with an awareness of the non-innocence of our positions... Learning with the world is allowing us to live well with(in) the contradictions and dangers we face.
>
> *(Visionary declarations, 5)*

 - The report operationalizes more-than-human communities through situated pedagogies: 

> Learning to become with the world is a situated practice and a more-than-human pedagogical collaboration.
>
> *(Visionary declarations, 5)*

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### EURIGHTS: Towards an EU Charter of the Fundamental Rights of Nature

- **Organisation**: EESC
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the Charter frames policy around an 'Earth Community' of interdependent life and uses this concept to derive rights, duties, and governance implications (nested rights, mutual enhancement), though it is not labelled 'more-than-human communities' verbatim.

- Community of life concept central to governance: 

> The Earth is a living being, a single Earth Community webbed together through interdependent relationships. All life is sacred with inherent value and the Earth has her thresholds and limits.
>
> *(Section 4.2, p. 51)*


- Mutual enhancement and reciprocity as operational principles: 

> Relationships within the Earth Community are reciprocal, a cycle of giving and receiving. Our role is to participate and contribute to the health and resilience of the Earth Community.
>
> *(Section 4.2, p. 52)*


- Rights (exist, habitat, role) are defined for all Earth Community members, informing goals and criteria for success: 

> The Earth and all of the Earth Community have three inherent rights: the right to exist, the right to habitat, and the right to fulfil their role in the ever-renewing processes of life.
>
> *(Section 4.2, p. 52)*

#### UNBOL2023: Plurinational State of Bolivia position on Nature-Based Solutions – UNEP Consultation

- **Organisation**: UNEP
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the document explicitly proposes consolidating ‘communities of life’ (more-than-human communities) as a policy objective with consequences for governance, education, and rights, though detailed institutional structures are not fully specified.

- Context/synthesis: The Annex contains a direct governance aim: 

> h) Promote the consolidation of communities of life for the harmonious coexistence of all living beings in the totality of Mother Earth.
>
> *(Annex)*


- Context/synthesis: The approach links to education, law, and participation such that communities of life become decision-relevant, not merely rhetorical: 

> f) Develop pedagogical and educational processes related to the Living Well in harmony and balance with Mother Earth... i) Implement actions to strengthen the role of Indigenous Peoples and local communities, women and youth in the protection of Mother Earth.
>
> *(Annex)*

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### UNCITIES21: Global environment outlook for cities – towards green and just cities (GEO for Cities)

- **Organisation**: UNEP & UN-Habitat
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the report conceptualizes cities as multispecies communities—explicitly valuing nonhuman members and their rights—and uses this lens to derive planning outcomes (habitats, corridors, buffers) and governance innovations, even if it does not codify a single institutional template.

- Conceptualization: 

> Such an approach encompasses the idea of a city that respects nature and protects and restores the diversity of life... a multispecies city... Humans do not live outside nature and our welfare is tied intimately to the fate of the other species with whom we share the planet.
>
> *(Chapter 4, 4.2.3)*


- Consequences for planning: Calls for corridors, habitat protection, multispecies emergency planning, and reconfigured public space as outcomes of thinking cities as more-than-human communities. (Chapter 4, 4.2.3)

- Equity and community wellbeing: Frames human well-being as interdependent with thriving nonhuman communities (ecosystem services, cultural benefits, health). (Chapter 3, 3.2.2; Chapter 4, 4.2.3)
