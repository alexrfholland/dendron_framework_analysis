# DATA_COLLECTION: Data collection

## Sources and Questions

### ICNATUREPOS24: Blueprint for a Nature-Positive Adelaide

**Question**: How can baseline biodiversity be established across metropolitan areas to set nature-positive targets and track change?

**Evidence**: “Targets and/or metrics for measuring and monitoring... have not yet been investigated or established at a regional level, and this in-turn limits the setting of targets... Only two case studies had appropriate baseline information from which to measure success.” (Section 7.3; Section 6.7)

### UNCITIES21: Global environment outlook for cities – towards green and just cities (GEO for Cities)

**Question**: How can cities overcome the lack of adequate, disaggregated, and timely data required to plan for more-than-human and human-inclusive environmental management?

**Evidence**: “Another key barrier to sustainable and just urban development is the lack of adequate data and data systems for planning. Many cities have little or no data that can provide relevant information on basic services for urban residents living in poverty in informal settlements. In some cases, despite 30 to 60 per cent of the urban population living in such conditions, basic information like street names and addresses is unavailable or missing.” (Chapter 2, 2.3.3)
“Disaggregated data that can be used by urban local bodies for planning and to meet international targets and goals like the SDGs and NDCs is often absent.” (Chapter 2, 2.3.3)

### EUONEHEALTH24: One Health governance in the European Union

**Question**: How can EU systems improve data access and sharing across institutions and communities for integrated One Health surveillance and decision-making?

**Evidence**: “Insufficient access to data and data sharing across different institutions and communities” (EU policies – SWOT analysis, Threats)
“There are no common databases for data sharing between partners.” (Leverage points – Case study 2 WNV surveillance, Gaps)

### IPBESTCA4: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 4. Overcoming the challenges of achieving transformative change

**Question**: How do data paucity and variability hinder understanding of human movement impacts on biodiversity and the formulation of solutions?

**Evidence**: “Paucity of data, temporal and spatial variability in data resolution, and differences in data quality – especially in remote areas or those of civil unrest – also act as barriers to the understanding of the impact of human movement patterns on biodiversity and the formulation of appropriate solutions.” (4.2.4)

### IPBESPATHWAYS19: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 5. Realizing a sustainable world for nature and people: transformative strategies, actions and roles for all

**Question**: What national-level data on dependence on nature and corporate impacts are required to inform policy decisions and monitor progress?

**Evidence**: 

> Nature reliance assessment: At the national level, few countries have assessed their dependence on nature. Information on the economic contributions of nature will be essential to inform policy decisions... Private sector accountability: Increased public reporting of the private sector would allow the analysis of the environmental impact of companies and monitor progress...

### EUHORIZON23: Horizon Europe strategic plan 2025–2027 analysis

**Question**: Which monitoring architectures and indicators are needed to observe nonhuman system states (e.g., biodiversity, water, microplastics) across scales?

**Evidence**: “Responding to this intertwined crisis necessitates... observation, monitoring, risk-based assessment and forecasting capacities, integrated prediction systems that combine the Earth’s system, ecosystem and social system models... Pollution is affecting the water system from source to sea, notably through plastics and microplastics... Overall, only 38% of Europe’s surface water bodies achieved good chemical status.” (Section 3.2.2 – Seas, oceans and inland waters)

### IPBESMODELS46: Report of the IPBES task force on scenarios and models – Nature Futures Scenarios

**Question**: How can we address gaps in indicators, especially for the ‘nature as culture’ perspective, and diversify data sources including ILK to proxy nonhuman perspectives?

**Evidence**: “Participants noted again that only a limited number of indicators was available for the ‘nature as culture’ value perspective, and that further development of indicators was needed in order to ensure coverage of all NFF value perspectives… They pointed out that cultural values tended to be perceived at a more local level.” (III.C)
“Participants suggested that refinement and diversification in data sources would be necessary… integrate different types of information such as indigenous and local knowledge.” (IV)

### EUDOLPHIN15: Dolphinaria - A Review of the Keeping of Whales and Dolphins in Captivity in the European Union and EC Directive 1999/22, Relating to the Keeping of Wild Animals in Zoos

**Question**: How can the EU ensure systematic, transparent reporting (pregnancies, births, deaths, transfers) for captive cetaceans to support science-based governance?

**Evidence**: - Context/synthesis: The report notes the absence of a central inventory and difficulty accessing data even for research. “There is no centralised or regulated inventory of dolphinaria in the EU and information-gathering on individual animals is largely dependent on internet searches and media articles... Any detailed data collected by dolphinaria... is not made available to the public and can be difficult to obtain even for scientific research.” (Introduction to dolphinaria in the EU)

- Context/synthesis: It recommends an EU-wide inventory with mandatory reporting. “Establish an EU-wide inventory of captive cetaceans... Facilities holding cetaceans should be required to report pregnancies, births, deaths, cause of death and transfers within 30 days... This information should be available to the public...” (Recommendations to the European Commission, point 1)

### NZOCEAN21: The breaking wave: reforming the oceans management system in Aotearoa New Zealand

**Question**: Difficulties collecting adequate on-demand data for multispecies/ecosystem indicators and bycatch.

**Evidence**: “the entanglement of one Māui and 29 Hector’s dolphins... is still cause for concern given the small populations... Could one reasonably expect bycatch to be zero?” (Chapter 2.6)
“Quantitative stock assessments... only 40 percent of fish stocks are ‘scientifically evaluated’... reliable CPUE data has only been available since 1990.” (Chapter 8.2)

---

### UKHYDRO22: Written evidence (LUE0078) to the Land Use in England Committee inquiry

**Question**: How can taxonomic and ecological data gaps be addressed (skills shortages, bias correction) to support robust species-focused planning?

**Evidence**: “There is likely to be a high demand, and possible shortage, of the taxonomic skills required to monitor the outcomes... Many such partnerships are struggling to account for the observational biases inherent in these on-the-ground species records... This requires significant expertise and must be done at national level...” (Q7 Response)

### UNESCOBIO11: Ethics and biodiversity

**Question**: Field data collection for biodiversity is time- and resource-constrained, limiting comprehensive assessment.

**Evidence**: “Combined with the practical difficulty of collecting the required field data due to a short supply of time, money and experts needed for proper sampling, few surveys can tally all species.” (1.4 Measuring Biodiversity)

---

### NPOS25: Draft State of Nature Metrics

**Question**: What are the data requirements (age, scale, ground-truthing) and how feasible is affordable access across geographies and capacities?

**Evidence**:  

> How well do the metrics perform? How sensitive are they?... Are these metrics and associated data sets affordable and accessible... Identifying appropriate data age requirements... Ground-truthing needs and characteristics... Definitions of 'surrounding area'...
