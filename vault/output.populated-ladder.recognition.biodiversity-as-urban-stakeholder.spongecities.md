# Sponge cities

## Score 4: Actionable Mechanisms

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### UNCITIES21: Global environment outlook for cities – towards green and just cities (GEO for Cities)

- **Organisation**: UNEP & UN-Habitat
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because the report uses sponge cities as a concrete policy/practice framework with specific examples, design elements (permeable pavements, rain gardens, green roofs), and cases (Shanghai, Wuhan), with measurable resilience outcomes and implementation pathways.

- Named framework and concrete measures: 

> Shanghai’s ambition to become a 'sponge city' for flood prevention through the replacement of concrete sidewalks with permeable pavements, street rain gardens and rooftop gardens.
>
> *(Chapter 5, 5.5.1)*


- Integration into resilience practice: 

> The scope and vision of infrastructure decisions – currently dominated by grey infrastructure projects – must be broadened to include blue-green systems as hybrid solutions for risk mitigation and adaptation.
>
> *(Chapter 2, 2.3.2)*


- Case-based implementation: 

> The city of Wuhan (China) ... decentralized model... water retention through bioswales, rainwater harvesting, green roofs.
>
> *(Chapter 5, 5.2.1 and 5.2.2; also Dai et al. 2018 referenced in text)*


- Outcomes and indicators: Reduced flood risk, improved infiltration, co-benefits for biodiversity and urban cooling are positioned as success criteria for sponge city interventions. (Chapter 2, 2.3.2; Chapter 4, 4.2.2)

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### IUCNBUILD25: Catalysing biodiversity on buildings: a review of supporting initiatives in European cities

- **Organisation**: IUCN
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Design/Engineering

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because ‘sponge city’ appears as a referenced integration within broader targets but is not elaborated as a full framework in this report. - “Blue Infrastructure target, through the adoption of Sponge City rainwater management including green roof/wall integration.” (3.5 Berlin Urban Nature Pact)
