# Multispecies voices, multispecies representation

## Score 4: Actionable Mechanisms

### IMPLEMENTATION AND METRICS

#### D4C25: Design for Environmental Conservation (Toolkit)

- **Organisation**: None
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Design/Engineering

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because the D4C method institutionalizes proxies for nonhuman representation (non-human personas, advocacy, species-led target setting) and integrates Indigenous frameworks (kaitiakitanga, maramataka), providing concrete mechanisms for multispecies voices in decision-making. 

- Explicit proxy representation mechanism: “Non-Human Personas: These represent species, ecosystems, or other natural elements… Because these personas will not have a voice in the projects, team members and specialists can be their advocates… choose target species with communities…” (Ch.7)

- Indigenous stewardship as representation: “Honoring Kaitiakitanga… Maaori have been the kaitiaki… Practices like rahui (temporarily restricting resource use) demonstrate this harmony… integration of Maramataka… as an environmental moon calendar… guiding seasonal activities like planting, harvesting, and fishing.” (Ch.2)

- Practical embedding in design cycles: “The D4C methodology comprises five interconnected stages… (Re)Connect… Understand… Propose and Validate… Plan for Impact… Deploy Sustainably… Stakeholder Characterization including nonhuman personas is central in ‘Understand’.” (Ch.5–7)

- Outcomes and indicators: “Impact Planning Tool… Unintended Impacts Canvas… Stakeholder Motivation Matrix aligns stakeholders around shared goals… ensuring that nonhuman motivations (e.g., ecosystem health flows) are considered in system maps.” (Ch.9–10)

#### DBIO23: Integrating biodiversity in urban development

- **Organisation**: None
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because the paper operationalizes representation by specifying mechanisms to 'listen' to and proxy nonhuman needs (nonhuman personas, species selection, citizen science, modelling), and by structuring participation via the nonhuman participation continuum/ladder to guide degrees of representation in design processes. 

- Representation framing and ladder: “The three roles identified for biodiversity as a stakeholder (passive, incidental or active) are equivalent to the non-participation, tokenistic participation, and citizen power categories for the ‘human’ participatory ladder... we present the beginnings of a participatory continuum for non-human stakeholders.” (4.1)

- Methods to elicit nonhuman perspectives: BID “seeks to co-design urban areas with clear input from biodiversity... a desire to ‘listen’ and understand what different species... need... by gathering information... and minimising key threats.” (4.3)

- Actionable representational tools: “non-human personas... to explicitly think about species’ interaction with the urban landscape... citizen science and participatory mapping... ecological modelling... least-cost modelling... building information systems... City Biodiversity Index...” (3.2; 4.3)

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### DWILD20: Designing wildlife-inclusive cities

- **Organisation**: None
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because the article institutionalizes nonhuman representation through target species selection, full life-cycle habitat integration, and Animal-Aided Design portraits, and specifies participatory selection of species with stakeholders within planning cycles. 

- Representation via target species: “The majority of case studies focused on a set of target species and addressed their critical habitat needs… the complete set of habitat requirements of a species has to be considered… target species portraits… serve as planning aids for urban design professionals.” (3.1)

- Participatory species selection: “choosing target species together with developers, built environment professionals and other project stakeholders, such as residents, may also help to prevent human-wildlife conflict.” (3.2)

- Embedded across stages: “interdisciplinary design teams that involve ecologists early on… consideration of the entire life-cycle of target species… post-occupancy monitoring…” (Abstract; 3.1)

- Outcomes/indicators: “biodiversity monitoring focused on target species… time-frame… success constitutes… remedial works… maintenance practices adjusted.” (3.1)

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### SCTRANSS25: Environment strategy for Scotland – transformative changes for sustainability

- **Organisation**: Scottish Government
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because the report explicitly proposes political mechanisms to represent nonhuman interests (micro-deliberative democracy with nonhuman representation, creative links to give nature an active voice), provides concrete steps, and explores implications and goals linked to more-than-human empowerment.

- It proposes actionable deliberative mechanisms to include nonhuman interests: 

> Micro-deliberative democracy (expand issues... represent non-human interests in decision-making, link to creative arts for nature having the active voice).
>
> *(Table 3: Political instruments)*


- It recommends creating political offices/positions to represent future generations including nonhuman nature, detailing outcomes and negotiation strategies: 

> Create sustainable future political position(s) that represents future generations, including non-human nature and more than human worlds.
>
> *(Table 3: Radical and speculative future-making)*


- It provides a concrete public sphere exemplar (Embassy of the North Sea) to institutionalise multispecies dialogue, and stresses equal footing: 

> Developing a public space in which humans can communicate with non-humans on an equal basis, the aim is to create new politics of representation... by 2030 the Embassy... will ‘emotionally, juridically, and political’ help us to relate to the North Sea in a fundamentally new way.
>
> *(7.3 Social and cultural policy instruments – Box 8)*


- It links representation to governance design and criteria of success (coexistence, reciprocity, care), integrating ethical, empirical, and political dimensions: 

> Give active voice to ‘nature’ in decision-making processes... engage with future-making initiatives... embed relationality and post-growth thinking...
>
> *(Table 3: Radical and speculative future-making)*

## Score 3: Core Conceptual Device / Implications Explored

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### EUSTI50: S&T&I for 2050: science, technology and innovation for ecosystem performance – accelerating sustainability transitions

- **Organisation**: EC DG R&I
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the source develops representation models (e.g., guardianships, 'Parliament of the Loire') and negotiation spaces where nonhuman interests are voiced by designed institutions, and explores substantive implications and outcomes in scenarios; however, it is not codified as a universal political mechanism across jurisdictions in the report.

- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> The movement of the Loire Parliament consults among relevant stakeholders and explores proposals for potential governance procedures and structures that could ensure the river’s interest in the long‑term.
>
> *(4.1.2 Rights of Nature – Limitations/Applications)*


- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Rather than applying overarching system rules, for each 'collective' a new contract must be negotiated that ensures a maximum of mutual care between diverse agents in a pluriverse of more than human beings... Strong role for science as mediator for other voices.
>
> *(2.3 Table 3; 2.3 Caring within hybrid collectives)*


- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Governments, private sector actors and communities have developed adaptive, innovative consent‑based approaches... Establishment of such partnership zones have allowed for drastic reductions in environmental footprints... Goals for ecosystem health have transitioned... Widespread implementation of rights of nature supports the introduction of new practice for co‑shaping – for negotiation human and non‑human interests and values.
>
> *(4.1.4 Scenario P2)*

#### IPBESPATHWAYS19: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 5. Realizing a sustainable world for nature and people: transformative strategies, actions and roles for all

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the chapter explicitly calls for giving voice and representation to non-humans within cultural and political processes, embeds this within inclusive governance discussions, and explores implications for negotiation and outcomes (responsibility to act, accountability), but it does not specify a procedural apparatus uniquely for nonhuman representatives (so not 4).

- The chapter explicitly advocates voice and representation for nonhumans: 

> Exploitative narratives can be challenged through political action and participatory deliberation that exposes injustice and gives voice and representation to humans and non-humans (de la Cadena & Blaser, 2018; Escobar, 2020; Whyte, 2020).
>
> *(5.7.2)*


- It links this to inclusive governance and decision-making structures: 

> Inclusive biodiversity governance involves strategies... to engage a broad range of stakeholders... including... non-human perspectives... Examples of mechanisms... deliberative democracy, multi-stakeholder partnerships... co-management of nature, biodiversity councils and committees, citizen science programmes...
>
> *(5.6.2)*


- The chapter connects representation with accountability and evaluation, embedding it in goals and indicators: 

> Transparent and inclusive review processes enable all actor groups to genuinely participate in evaluation processes and foster mutual learning.
>
> *(Exec. summary, point 9)*

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### NZOCEAN21: The breaking wave: reforming the oceans management system in Aotearoa New Zealand

- **Organisation**: Environmental Defence Society
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the report explicitly develops options to institutionalise the ‘voice’ of the ocean and nonhuman representation (e.g., legal personhood with an Oceans Commission as the voice of te moana), and uses this to derive governance outcomes and criteria, though without a fully specified statutory blueprint. 

- Representation proposal and implications: 

> Going further, should society build institutions that give the oceans a voice of their own? ... what would be the challenges in giving the oceans as a whole legal personhood (eg through recognition as Tangaroa or Hinemoana)?
>
> *(Chapter 4.8)*


- Institutionalisation of a ‘voice’: 

> An Oceans Commission or similar could be constituted as a national oceans co-governance body with iwi... It could even be a vehicle through which te moana is given legal personhood (with the Commission being the voice of te moana).
>
> *(Chapter 7.3 Options)*


- Criteria and ends: 

> What do they want? If we stop to listen, what does the voice of the ocean tell us? And how will we, as kaitiaki and stewards of our vast oceans, answer?
>
> *(Chapter 9 Concluding comments)*

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### UNCITIES21: Global environment outlook for cities – towards green and just cities (GEO for Cities)

- **Organisation**: UNEP & UN-Habitat
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the report explicitly argues for representation and 'voice' for nonhumans in urban governance and works through consequences and proposals (e.g., governance mechanisms, regulatory strategies), but stops short of prescribing one unified institutional model; instead, it presents case-inspired options and hypothetical implications.

- Foundational claim (ethical/political): 

> This may require exploring ways to give a voice in governance to non-humans (Beatley and Bekoff 2013) and developing regulatory strategies to protect plants and animals from harm.
>
> *(Chapter 4, 4.2.3)*


- Implications and negotiation strategies: 

> Humans do not live outside nature and our welfare is tied intimately to the fate of the other species with whom we share the planet... preparing people for new animals... as a result of climate change or biodiversity loss... may require... buffers to protect animals from human intrusion and to protect people from the dangers of the presence of wildlife.
>
> *(Chapter 4, 4.2.3)*


- Application to outcomes/goals: The dimension frames a rights-to-the-city lens across species, informing design of biodiversity plans and disaster preparedness as outcomes with clear metrics (corridor presence, species protection zones, emergency sheltering for animals). (Chapter 4, 4.2.3)
