# RISK_BENEFIT: Risk benefit relationships

## Sources and Questions

### UNLAND17_2: The Global Land Outlook: Part 2 - The Outlook

**Question**: How should we weigh climate and biodiversity risks versus energy and economic benefits for biofuels and dams?

**Evidence**: 

> Biofuel expansion in productive tropical ecosystems will always lead to net carbon emissions for decades or centuries while increased biofuel production on degraded or abandoned agricultural land could provide an almost immediate net reduction in carbon emissions... A major switch to biofuels could easily have unintended climate consequences through land use change and agricultural intensification.

> *(Chapter 7, Biofuels)*

> Dam building provides great benefits in terms of power but has major social and environmental side‑effects... blocking critical annual water pulses; trapping fish larvae and young; disrupting river transport and food supply; and dramatically reducing downstream and coastal sedimentation.

> *(Chapter 8, Disruption of natural flows; Box 8.2 Amazon)*

### EIVIS23: Exploring new visions for a sustainable bioeconomy

**Question**: How to avoid perverse incentives (e.g., CAP payments) that harm biodiversity while transitioning agri-food systems?

**Evidence**: “Our public policy greatly exacerbates it... the Common Agricultural Policy... creates a massive perverse incentive for habitat clearance and habitat destruction... environmental campaigners have been pressing for years... but nothing is done.” (p. 31-32)

### EUDOLPHIN15: Dolphinaria - A Review of the Keeping of Whales and Dolphins in Captivity in the European Union and EC Directive 1999/22, Relating to the Keeping of Wild Animals in Zoos

**Question**: What are the public health and safety risks of close human–cetacean interactions (including Dolphin Assisted Therapy), and how should they be governed?

**Evidence**: - Context/synthesis: The report documents risks to both humans and dolphins from close-contact programmes and shows. “Twenty dolphinaria offer visitors the opportunity to get close to cetaceans... Direct contact between the public and captive cetaceans places both parties at significant risk of disease and injury.” (Summary)

- Context/synthesis: It cites zoonotic and safety evidence and calls for prohibitions. “Dolphins can pass diseases to humans and vice versa... trainers feed the dolphins... may encourage visitors to approach and feed cetaceans in the wild, again putting both parties at considerable risk... Prohibit contact between cetaceans and members of the public...” (Public safety and risks to wild dolphins; Recommendations to Member States, points 4–6)
