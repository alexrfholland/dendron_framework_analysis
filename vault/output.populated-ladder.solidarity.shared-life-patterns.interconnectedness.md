## Score 3: Core Conceptual Device / Implications Explored

### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### COMESTWATER22: Report of COMEST on water ethics: ocean, freshwater and coastal areas

- **Organisation**: UNESCO COMEST
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because interconnectedness is a core conceptual device used throughout to justify ecocentric ethics, multi-body water governance, and cross-SDG trade-off management; it is applied to human and nonhuman interdependence and informs practical governance and monitoring needs. 

- The report frames hydrological and ecological systems as tightly coupled: 

> climate change is fostering a new understanding of the integration of these water bodies, and has also increased the attention to the cryosphere… COMEST suggests a holistic approach which seeks to link these water bodies… addresses both human and ecosystem concerns.
>
> *(Introductory Remarks, 2–4)*


- It stresses interdependency across species and systems: 

> a holistic approach calls for human beings to recognise in addition to their own dependency, the dependency of other living beings on water systems.
>
> *(Introductory Remarks, 4)*


- It operationalizes implications in governance: 

> The impact of climate change on the global water cycle should be regularly monitored… Periodic reports of water related quantitative indicators should be developed and adopted by the relevant scientific communities.
>
> *(VII.c.v)*


- It applies across legal and ethical domains (oceans, transboundary waters, plastics): 

> Tackling the truly global problem of plastic refuse calls for a holistic approach to water management.
>
> *(I.6 Pollution; Plastic and Microplastic Pollution – a Global Challenge)*

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### EUONEHEALTH24: One Health governance in the European Union

- **Organisation**: SAPEA
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because interconnectedness (and interdependence) is a core conceptual mechanism shaping the report’s theory of change, governance design, and evaluation; the report works through implications for implementation (integration vs unification, indicators, trade-offs), but does not translate interconnectedness itself into standalone policy instruments beyond One Health.

- The report’s philosophical foundation centres on interconnection and interdependence as the ontology and epistemology for One Health, with explicit implementation implications (integration vs unification): 

> We then explore three sets of concepts in the definition: 'integrated' and 'unifying'; 'balanced' and 'optimised'; 'closely linked' and 'interdependent'... Close linkage... is a way of integrating entities presumed to be distinct... 'Interdependence' is more extreme... We understand these two concepts as existing on a spectrum.
>
> *(One Health definition – Starting from OHHLEP; 'Closely linked' and 'interdependent')*


- It uses interconnectedness to define ecosystem governance and indicators, translating the concept into measurable consequences: 

> Our definition of One Health requires several key issues to be considered: interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity; sociocultural and ethical dimensions; and economic factors... cooperation should lead to benefits that can be recognised and measured in terms of biological, environmental, social and economic indicators.
>
> *(One Health definition – Summary; Chapter 3 – Why do we need indicators?)*


- It discusses practical trade-offs and co-benefits under an interconnected SDG/One Health lens, informing negotiation strategies and prioritisation: 

> As with One Health, the goals themselves are interlinked and interdependent; understanding the relationships between the goals is therefore essential to understand where the goals work in concert and in conflict... A One Health approach offers an important entry point for this discussion of trade-offs and synergies.
>
> *(EU policies – The international One Health policy landscape)*


- It links interconnectedness to system design across scales and sectors, guiding participation and integration activities (e.g., citizen involvement, knowledge-brokering, boundary organisations): 

> To make use of transdisciplinary insights, we must address questions of scaling... develop collaborative strategies that transcend disciplinary and geographical boundaries... Involving citizens in these initiatives can enhance community engagement...
>
> *(One Health definition – Interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary collaboration)*


- It frames ecosystemic thinking (sympoiesis, more-than-human) as the conceptual base for redesigning governance and metrics, signalling implications beyond rhetoric: 

> We take inspiration from... Donna Haraway... emphasises sympoiesis (becoming together)... 'more-than-human'... such an 'ecosystem philosophy' is original to many Indigenous perspectives...
>
> *(One Health definition – 'Ecosystem' and 'environment')*

#### IPBESPATHWAYS19: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 5. Realizing a sustainable world for nature and people: transformative strategies, actions and roles for all

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because interconnectedness is central to Strategy 5 and the whole chapter’s framing (humans and nature in complex webs), with explicit implications for outcomes (nature connectedness, social norms), governance (integration, inclusivity), and indicators (new metrics), yet not tied to a single operational instrument.

- Strategy 5 explicitly prioritizes interconnections: 

> shifting societal views and values to recognize and prioritize the fundamental interconnections between humans and nature.
>
> *(Exec. summary heading; 5.7)*


- The chapter operationalizes this concept through education, governance, and narrative tools: 

> Encouraging multifaceted engagement with nature... helps cultivate recognition that humans are part of nature and can live as nature...
>
> *(Exec. summary, point 10)*

 and 

> Inclusive governance... incorporating different knowledge systems... foster mutual learning.
>
> *(Exec. summary, points 8–9)*


- It links interconnections to measurable outcomes and indicators: revised metrics and accounting frameworks to include nature’s contributions are proposed as success criteria (5.5.4).

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### NZOCEAN21: The breaking wave: reforming the oceans management system in Aotearoa New Zealand

- **Organisation**: Environmental Defence Society
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because interconnectedness is explicitly foregrounded (ki uta ki tai, land–sea connectivity) and used to derive integrated planning/governance solutions (marine spatial planning, legislative integration), shaping goals, strategies, and criteria across ethical, scientific, and political contexts. 

- Foundational framing of connected systems: 

> There is no border wall between land and sea, or between catchment and coast... It is dangerous to view oceans in isolation from the land on which humans conduct most of their activities...
>
> *(Chapter 2.2)*


- Integrated design implication (outcomes/indicators): 

> We are taking a 'thematic' approach... to encourage thinking about the system as a highly interconnected whole... tools like marine spatial planning and an oceans policy/strategy... are like 'glue' that binds them together.
>
> *(Chapter 1.5; Chapter 1.7)*


- Policy criteria and instruments: 

> It is particularly important to note that we are 'using' the marine environment’s assimilative and diluting capacity when we discharge or dump contaminants... the seas get two types of pollutants for the price of one.
>
> *(Chapter 2.4/2.7)*


- Governance consequence (legislative integration): 

> It would be possible to have a general discussion about what tools are desirable without first determining exactly where they will fit... Legislative arrangements should be moulded around the tools that are likely to be most effective, not the other way around.
>
> *(Chapter 1.8; Chapter 6)*

#### UNESCOAI23: Recommendation on the ethics of artificial intelligence

- **Organisation**: UNESCO
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because interconnectedness is articulated as a core value ('Living in peaceful, just and interconnected societies') used to guide principles (e.g., proportionality, fairness) and policy areas (stakeholder participation), shaping goals and evaluation, though not prescribing specific institutional structures. - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Living in peaceful, just and interconnected societies... points to the potential of AI systems to contribute throughout their life cycle to the interconnectedness of all living creatures with each other and with the natural environment.
>
> *(III.1 Values)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> This value demands that peace, inclusiveness and justice, equity and interconnectedness should be promoted throughout the life cycle of AI systems... should not... threaten the coexistence between humans, other living beings and the natural environment.
>
> *(III.1 Values)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Participation of different stakeholders throughout the AI system life cycle is necessary for inclusive approaches to AI governance, enabling the benefits to be shared by all, and to contribute to sustainable development.
>
> *(III.2 Principles – Multi-stakeholder and adaptive governance and collaboration)*

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### EUCLIM24: Towards sustainable transformation: research priorities in climate change and biodiversity

- **Organisation**: EC
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because interconnectedness is positioned as a foundational systems perspective linking climate, biodiversity, health, governance, and finance, shaping research questions and cross-sector policy mixes, though not prescribing specific institutional templates. - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> The intertwined crises of climate change and biodiversity loss must be addressed together... a ‘nexus approach’ to governance... to generate synergistic wins and avoid unintended consequences while facilitating deep and rapid transformative change.
>
> *(Introduction)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> A transdisciplinary exercise... recognizing the importance of different types of knowledge and expertise... sustainability science advances a holistic and solutions-forward understanding of global change.
>
> *(Introduction)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Treating climate, biodiversity and human society as coupled systems is key to successful outcomes from policy interventions... develop policy mixes that are effective... while maximi sing synergies amongst them and contributing to the systemic goal.
>
> *(Section 5.1)*

## Score 2: Theoretical Treatment

### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### UNSECURITY24: Envisioning security for a more-than-human world

- **Organisation**: UNDP
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because interconnectedness is a sustained theme linking human, animal, and environmental systems, supporting the case for integrated security, but it remains conceptual. - It emphasizes coupled systems: “Global health governance must involve a global-scale securitization strategy that recognizes the world’s transnational interconnections of threat and risk... governments prioritize the safety of their own citizens... We have witnessed this... with the ‘vaccine nationalism’ surrounding COVID-19.” (Global health governance) - It repeats human–nonhuman interdependence: “The ‘convergence of people, animals, and our environment has created a new dynamic in which the health of each group is inextricably interconnected’...” (One Health section)

---

#### EUANTHRO: Exiting the Anthropocene? Exploring fundamental change in our relationship with nature

- **Organisation**: EEA
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the briefing elaborates the ‘interconnectedness’ concept in biological, psychological and governance terms (supraorganism, microbiome, ‘all of us’) and translates it into narrative and policy implications.

- Context/synthesis: It frames individuals as relational beings (Oliver 2020) and suggests implications for behaviour and governance: “From biological and psychological perspectives, individuality is an illusion... it is of outmost importance to acknowledge that we are interconnected.” (p.8)

- Context/synthesis: It recommends shifting from ‘us/them’ to ‘all of us’ to align needs of other organisms in governance and motivate biodiversity protection: “We should switch from the ‘us and them’ mindset to a relational concept of ‘all of us’ to unlock new motivations to protect biodiversity...” (Key messages)

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### IPBESTCA2: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 2. Visions of a sustainable world – for nature and people

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because interconnectedness is a repeated organizing principle in the chapter’s theory of change and Indigenous visions, but it is used conceptually rather than as a formal framework with mechanisms.

- Interconnectedness is presented as a core systems insight of visioning processes: 

> Visioning processes help people see the connections among system dimensions and processes including views, structures and practices that influence human-nature relations, sometimes expressed as social imaginaries...
>
> *(Executive Summary point 8; 2.4.2)*


- Indigenous visions emphasize inseparability: 

> Visions consistently emphasize the need to address nature as an interconnected yet inseparable part of life that comprises nature and livelihoods as well as the physical, spiritual and intellectual components of life.
>
> *(Box 2.3)*


- Prevents higher score: no explicit toolkit or institutional arrangements are provided under this concept.

#### UNTRANS25: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 1. Transformative change and a sustainable world

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because interconnectedness is discussed in depth conceptually (e.g., 'interbeing', human–nature interdependence), but without concrete mechanisms for more-than-human empowerment. - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Respectful and reciprocal human-nature relationships entails recognition of humans as a part of nature and overcoming (false) separations... It aims to dismantle hierarchies of domination... This highlights the possibility of relating to beings other than humans as subjects and kin... a recognition of interconnected becoming, or 'interbeing'.
>
> *(Section 1.3.2)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> There is strong agreement that opportunities to act and innovate or behave differently at local scales can be restricted by views, structures, and practices originating in broader scales and levels.
>
> *(Section 1.4.1)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Because views, structures and practices influence each other across scales and levels, some interventions and actions will create impacts beyond their initial starting point.
>
> *(Section 1.4.1)*

#### EUTRANS24: Mapping ERC frontier research: addressing climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution

- **Organisation**: ERC
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report repeatedly foregrounds interconnections (triple planetary crisis, leverage point interactions, social–ecological–technical linkages) and elaborates the need for integrated, multi-actor, interdisciplinary approaches, though not framed as a stand-alone policy mechanism.

- Context/synthesis: It opens with interconnected crises (climate, biodiversity, pollution) and positions ERC frontier research to address system interactions and trade-offs. 

> No country... is immune to the devastation inflicted by climate change, biodiversity loss, land degradation and pollution... Both IPCC and IPBES have shown unequivocally that this will require profound transformation...
>
> *(Foreword)*


- Context/synthesis: It structures leverage points (institutions, behaviors, finance) and emphasizes combined effects (e.g., policy backlash dynamics, green–green conflicts), showing how interconnectedness drives research and policy design. 

> ProblemShifting... trade-offs... ‘green‑green’ conflicts... BACKLASH... when backlash occurs, it can be very impactful...
>
> *(2.1)*

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### ISCHEALTH21: Urban health and wellbeing in the Anthropocene: interdisciplinary science-action plan 2021–2025

- **Organisation**: ISC/ISUH/IAP
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because interconnectedness is treated as a core descriptive concept across the report, linking human, urban, and planetary systems, but it serves to set the systems problem context rather than providing concrete mechanisms that empower nonhumans. - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: The plan grounds its systemic approach in interlinkages and feedbacks between human and environmental systems, framing how risks and health determinants co-arise: 

> As the recent COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated, the interlinkages, synergies, trade-offs and feedbacks between human systems and environmental systems in a rapidly urbanizing world make such integrated approach of human health and planetary health necessary and urgent.
>
> *(Preface One)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: It emphasizes that urban, peri-urban, rural and natural environments are interdependent determinants of planetary health, making interconnectedness a central analytic lens: 

> The impact of the Urban Health and Wellbeing Programme has crossed the boundaries well beyond those of the city and has shown us how urban, peri-urban, rural and natural environments are all interlinked and interdependent determinants of planetary health.
>
> *(Foreword)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: Interconnectedness also underpins the risk framing (contagious stresses and systemic risks), highlighting complex propagation across systems: 

> What intensifies these stresses are: the growing frequency of acute stresses and the compounding combined effect of acute and social stresses and the contagiousness of stresses.
>
> *(Section 2.1)*

#### SCTRANSS25: Environment strategy for Scotland – transformative changes for sustainability

- **Organisation**: Scottish Government
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because interconnectedness is a conceptual framing throughout the relationality sections, used to justify ethics of care and nonhuman agency considerations, but it is not a standalone operational framework with tools in this report.

- The report repeatedly emphasises entanglement and interdependencies among humans and nonhumans: 

> Humans are not just part of nature, but human-nature relations are entangled... interdependencies encourage a focus on mutualism and reciprocity...
>
> *(3.3 Relationality)*


- This concept is harnessed to shift values and goals (care, reciprocity), informing the criteria for policy success, not a distinct policy package. (3.3; Table 3)
