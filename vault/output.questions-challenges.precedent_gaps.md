# PRECEDENT_GAPS: Precedent gaps

## Sources and Questions

### ICNATUREPOS24: Blueprint for a Nature-Positive Adelaide

**Question**: How can demonstration and guidance accelerate uptake in private realms and mainstream sectors?

**Evidence**: “The private realm could be better engaged... There is often a missed opportunity for engagement and integration of BSUD principles into the private realm... Use demonstration sites in iconic areas such as the Adelaide Zoo, and the Botanic Gardens to engage the residents and complement existing Garden Guides.” (Section 6.2)

### UNCITIES21: Global environment outlook for cities – towards green and just cities (GEO for Cities)

**Question**: Where are the real-world exemplars of deep, holistic urban transformations that include nonhumans, and how can they be scaled responsibly?

**Evidence**: “As stated by Maassen and Galvin (2019): ‘[r]eal world examples of deep urban transformations are hard to come by.’” (Summary for city-level decision makers, p. 11)
“Scaling up and mainstreaming change is difficult to achieve and sustain and requires ongoing feedback loops and learning to maintain, deepen and adapt to evolving circumstances.” (Chapter 2, 2.4.3)

### IPBESTCA2: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 2. Visions of a sustainable world – for nature and people

**Question**: How can the global community develop formalized, biodiversity-centred scenarios and pathways to reach the 2050 Vision of living in harmony with nature?

**Evidence**: “There are no formalized global scenarios yet for achieving the transformative change needed to reach the 2050 Vision of living in harmony with nature, although promising scenarios are emerging.” (Executive Summary point 8; 2.2.4)

### EUSTI50: S&T&I for 2050: science, technology and innovation for ecosystem performance – accelerating sustainability transitions

**Question**: Limited comparative examples and evaluation of multispecies representation experiments and legal personhood outside a few jurisdictions.

**Evidence**: “Challenges to the legal approaches of the RoN have revealed mixed results... Despite the constitutional provision in Ecuador, several cases have been lost... in Colombia... court orders have been made to establish personhood of the Atrato River... In the U.S., some ENGOs have been able to obtain standing... others... tossed out as unconstitutional.” (4.1.2 Rights of Nature applications and Limitations)

### DWILD20: Designing wildlife-inclusive cities

**Question**: How can best-practice knowledge be generalized across contractors with little experience and varied contexts (e.g., green roofs)?

**Evidence**: “Most contractors had only little experience with wildlife-inclusive urban design… careful selection and training of building- and garden contractors was necessary… especially in the case of green roofs, where there are limited opportunities to integrate habitat… adjustments may often be necessary.” (3.1)

### PBLCITIES21: Realising the Urban Opportunity: Cities and the Post-2020 Biodiversity Governance

**Question**: How can diverse city networks and platforms (e.g., CitiesWithNature) be leveraged to ratchet urban ambition for biodiversity?

**Evidence**: “The development of CitiesWithNature as a means through which this can be achieved is a vital step… Further work to build on existing urban action and to recognise the diverse array of new initiatives… together with clear and verifiable reporting systems will be needed if urban ambitions are going to be sustained and realised over the next 10 years.” (Summary; Section 4.3)

### GEAURBANGREEN23: Tackling the Climate and Biodiversity Crises in Europe through Urban Greening Plans

**Question**: What best practices, tested business/investment models, and harmonised indicators exist (or are needed) to scale UGP across diverse planning systems?

**Evidence**: - Context/synthesis: The report asks for best practices, case studies, and tested financing/investment mechanisms to scale urban greening. 

> Providing best practices of tested business and investment models for urban greening at varying scales... and financing mechanisms, including supporting tools to increase the uptake and scalability of available green financial instruments suited for UGI/NbS;
>
> *(Section 5, Recommendation 5)*


- Context/synthesis: It also suggests drawing on EU project indicator repertoires and harmonising across instruments. 

> To develop key performance indicators, cities can draw on a large repertoire of impact indicators for NbS composed by Horizon 2020 NbS projects... SMART and coherent with the targets of related policy instruments and commitments across governance levels.
>
> *(Section 5, Recommendation 4)*

### EURIGHTS: Towards an EU Charter of the Fundamental Rights of Nature

**Question**: How to deal with the absence of common constitutional traditions on environmental protection across EU Member States?

**Evidence**: “Outlining a ‘common constitutional tradition’ of the Member States regarding the concept of environment is quite complex... there are different forms of environmental protection within the individual European States... the absence of the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights aimed at protecting the environment as an ‘ecosystem’... the presence of different procedural systems for the protection of rights in the Member States.” (Section 6.3, p. 98-99)

---

### DBIO23: Integrating biodiversity in urban development

**Question**: How can diverse terminology and fragmented practices be unified to avoid confusion and enable widespread adoption?

**Evidence**: “Many different terms are used to describe BID... However, the diversity within the terminology can be divisive and confusing for practitioners. The use of ‘Biodiversity Inclusive Design’ as a unifying concept can help formalise the practice as a design theory.” (4.3)

---

### NPOS25: Draft State of Nature Metrics

**Question**: What constitutes acceptable claims and recognition practices linked to the metrics, and what precedents should guide usage?

**Evidence**:  

> Further work is needed to assess how claims can/should be used in relation to the metrics... Nature positive claims and recognition... Assessment of needs for claims and recognition guidance.
>
> *(Scope; Open questions to address)*
