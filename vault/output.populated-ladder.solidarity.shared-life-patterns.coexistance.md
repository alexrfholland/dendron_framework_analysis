### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### IUCNBUILD25: Catalysing biodiversity on buildings: a review of supporting initiatives in European cities

- **Organisation**: IUCN
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Design/Engineering

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the report operationalizes human–wildlife coexistence in cities via concrete policies (bird-safe standards, lighting regimes, nest sites), tools, and examples, exploring implications, trade-offs, and outcomes; although advisory, it provides actionable pathways. - It defines wildlife-friendly buildings as a necessary complement to greening: “Another critical topic... wildlife-friendly buildings... minimise the risks and threats to wildlife at the building scale... bird-safe glazing solutions... protections to reduce the detrimental effects of light and noise pollution on wildlife.” (2.3) - It details concrete standards (San Francisco, Toronto, EU guidance) with criteria for success: “San Francisco’s Standards for Bird-Safe Buildings... requirements include bird-safe window glazing, lighting... The EU... recommends... downward lighting... 3000 K or lower... dimming... shielding...” (4.3.1; 4.3.2) - It specifies resource provisions (nest boxes, insect hotels, bat towers) and case studies, linking design to urban species needs: “Special resources such as nesting boxes and refuge for pollinators.” (2); “The city has also supported... bat nest towers, bird nest boxes, insect hotels, wildlife ramps...” (Barcelona case) - It works through ethical/political trade-offs (historic preservation, housing) and negotiation strategies to realize coexistence: “Historic preservation... perceived competition for space with affordable housing... measures... can support greater housing density and simultaneously increased biodiversity...” (Conclusions)
