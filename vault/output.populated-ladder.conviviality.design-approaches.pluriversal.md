# Autonomous and pluriversal design, frugal abundance

## Score 4: Actionable Mechanisms

### IMPLEMENTATION AND METRICS

#### D4C25: Design for Environmental Conservation (Toolkit)

- **Organisation**: None
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Design/Engineering

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because the book explicitly adopts pluriversal thinking (Escobar) and operationalizes it through a full participatory design toolkit (D4C) with concrete steps, tools, roles, indicators, and iterative implementation pathways for distributed, decolonial environmental conservation. 

- Foundational concept and thread: “Decolonizing conservation… Arturo Escobar’s ‘pluriversal thinking’ concept provides a valuable framework, emphasizing the coexistence of multiple worldviews and knowledge systems… The D4C methodology doesn’t aim to impose one way of thinking over another. Instead, it provides a space for collaboration and mutual learning.” (Ch.2)

- Operational tools and roles to enact pluriversality: “The D4C framework includes five main stages… These stages offer a flexible, iterative process… Teams can access the toolkit… Stakeholder Characterization… Stories as Knowledge… Immersive Excursion… Idea Selection… Impact Planning… Deploy Sustainably… Any user can download all tools in design4conservation.com.” (Ch.5)

- Outcomes, negotiation strategies, indicators: “Impact measurement is crucial… Sustainability Radar: Visualize sustainability goals and innovation progress… Impact Planning Tool: Create actionable impact strategies… Unintended Impacts Canvas: Anticipate and address potential ripple effects.” (Ch.9)

- Political/ethical/technical integration: “This approach complements rational, scientific paradigms and extends the invitation for communities to take ownership of their environmental futures, offering a hopeful, holistic, place-based approach to restoring our ecosystems and our connection to the land.” (Ch.1)

## Score 3: Core Conceptual Device / Implications Explored

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### IPBESPATHWAYS19: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 5. Realizing a sustainable world for nature and people: transformative strategies, actions and roles for all

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the chapter explicitly adopts ‘pluriversal’ orientations (Escobar) as a core conceptual foundation for Strategy 5, linking them to outcomes (relational care), negotiations (narratives), and goals (living well in harmony with nature). However, it does not set out a specific pluriversal design process with concrete steps (so not 4).

- Pluriversal living is a central orientation: 

> This involves embracing a multiplicity of worldviews and cultural perspectives, known as ‘pluriversal living’ (Escobar, 2018) and fostering reciprocal, care-oriented and non-exploitative relationships with nature and people.
>
> *(5.7)*


- Narrative and design implications: 

> It makes way for pluriversal imaginaries... that celebrate human-nature interdependencies and reciprocities and recognize the agency and rights of non-human life to flourish.
>
> *(5.7.2)*


- The figure frames shifts toward “Ecocentric and pluriversal formations based on autonomy and reciprocity,” indicating goals and success criteria (Figure 5.12).

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### SCTRANSS25: Environment strategy for Scotland – transformative changes for sustainability

- **Organisation**: Scottish Government
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because pluriversality is a core theme in the report’s speculative and decolonial future-making, with explicit implications and practices (world-building, artists, Indigenous cosmologies), though not fixed into a single regulatory instrument.

- The report foregrounds pluriversality as necessary for future-making beyond dominant techno-market imaginaries: 

> World-building refers to exploring and creating new futures that are pluriversal in nature (i.e. recognize that there are ‘many worlds in this world’, beyond dominant ones).
>
> *(Foreword; footnote)*


- It sets out practical methods to enact the pluriverse (arts, Indigenous perspectives, participatory research), linking to decision-making: 

> Support speculative futures exploration by artists and environmental humanities... Explore plural and relational ways of thinking, being and knowing in exploring futures, e.g. Indigenous conceptions.
>
> *(Table 3: Radical and speculative future-making)*


- It connects pluriversality to policy goals and evaluation (ethics of care, reciprocity, conviviality), clarifying outcomes: 

> This involves... giving space to plural forms of knowledge... ethics of care for multiple species... inform broader governmental... strategies...
>
> *(Foreword; 3.3 Relationality)*


- It also addresses implications and barriers (scientism, co-option), showing consequences of adopting pluriversal design: 

> Dominant approaches... can restrict future visions... need to support a wider range of potential futures... beyond common sense science-technology and market assumptions...
>
> *(7.3 Social and cultural policy instruments)*

## Score 2: Theoretical Treatment

### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### UNESCOEDU20: Learning to become with the world: education for future survival

- **Organisation**: Common Worlds/UNESCO
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Humanities/Ethics

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the source meaningfully discusses pluriversal frameworks (Escobar, Kothari) and their implications for education and justice, but treats them conceptually and does not operationalize autonomous/pluriversal design methods. - The report grounds its ethical reframing in pluriversal ontologies: 

> We have increasingly engaged with the ‘pluriversal’ frameworks (Escobar, 2018; Kothari et al., 2019)... that presuppose that there are infinite human and more-than-human worlds within worlds, all of which are animate and radically interdependent.
>
> *(Visionary declarations, 1)*

 - It describes applying pluriversality in curricula and ethics: 

> Through learning and teaching the principles of pluriversality... we have expanded our notion of justice. As a result, the practice of education is now infinitely more inclusive.
>
> *(Visionary declarations, 1)*

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### EUHORIZON23: Horizon Europe strategic plan 2025–2027 analysis

- **Organisation**: European Commission
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the text uses the pluriverse concept explicitly to frame a non-anthropocentric ontology for ecosystems governance (

> pluriverse of hybrid entities with agency

), implying design-relevant orientations; however, it does not go on to outline design practices or institutions that implement pluriversal design.

- The foresight contrasts three perspectives, one of which explicitly posits a pluriverse of agents: 

> Caring within hybrid collectives... Pluriverse of hybrid entities with agency emerging out of relations with each other... Negotiate with other inhabitants of critical zones to allow all to flourish on their own terms; adapt to nature and its diversity.
>
> *(Section 1.4 – Table on perspectives for flourishing ecosystems)*


- The implications for R&I (hybrid collectives, negotiation) suggest relevance for design approaches that accommodate multiple ontologies and agencies beyond the human. (Section 1.4)

- No specific design methodologies or institutional steps are provided to operationalise pluriversal design in EU programmes, hence a conceptual (score 2) rather than actionable use.
