## Score 4: Actionable Mechanisms

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### UNESCOAI23: Recommendation on the ethics of artificial intelligence

- **Organisation**: UNESCO
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because human rights are the explicit foundation of the Recommendation (values, principles, and monitoring), and the document provides detailed, actionable policy areas with concrete mechanisms (impact assessments, governance, data, sectoral actions) for Member States and AI actors to implement, monitor, and evaluate. - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Convinced that the Recommendation... based on international law, focusing on human dignity and human rights, as well as gender equality... and environmental and ecosystem protection can guide AI technologies in a responsible direction.
>
> *(Preamble)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Respect, protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms and human dignity... Human rights and fundamental freedoms must be respected, protected and promoted throughout the life cycle of AI systems.
>
> *(III.1 Values)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Member States should introduce frameworks for impact assessments... identify impacts on human rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular but not limited to the rights of marginalized and vulnerable people... and facilitate citizen participation...
>
> *(Policy Area 1: Ethical Impact Assessment)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Member States should ensure that harms caused through AI systems are investigated and redressed, by enacting strong enforcement mechanisms and remedial actions... promote auditability and traceability...
>
> *(Policy Area 2: Ethical Governance and Stewardship)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Adequate data protection frameworks and governance mechanisms should be established... protected by judicial systems, and ensured throughout the life cycle of AI systems.
>
> *(III.2 Principles – Right to Privacy, and Data Protection)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Processes for monitoring and evaluation should ensure broad participation of all stakeholders... develop tools and indicators for assessing the effectiveness and efficiency... including specific targets for persons belonging to disadvantaged, marginalized populations.

## Score 2: Theoretical Treatment

### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### COMESTWATER22: Report of COMEST on water ethics: ocean, freshwater and coastal areas

- **Organisation**: UNESCO COMEST
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report centrally frames water as a human right and uses a human-rights-based approach throughout, offering recommendations for implementation, which fits the Paternalism rung criterion of being a core focus for shallow paternalism frameworks, but it is still human-centric. 

- The report explicitly grounds its ethics in the human right to water and proposes its implementation in governance: 

> The United Nations General Assembly, in Resolution 64/292, acknowledged that clean drinking water and sanitation are essential to the realisation of all human rights. However, treating water as ’commons’ can go beyond notions of human rights and equity to the rights of non-human beings.
>
> *(VI.1 Human Dignity and Human Rights)*


- It details legal status, implications, and calls for implementation mechanisms: 

> States should do their utmost to implement national, regional and international regulations and laws related to all aspects of freshwater, coastal and marine management, while taking into account the importance of a human rights-based approach and the interdependence of humankind with the ecosystem.
>
> *(VII. Recommendations, a.i)*


- The report critically examines enforceability and governance of rights: 

> only by considering the right to water in its legal, theoretical and practical context all at once can the present status and future potential of the right to water be fully addressed
>
> *(VI.1; citing Thielbörger, 2013)*


- It presents responsibilities and global obligations tied to human rights: 

> guaranteeing access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation becomes a genuinely global responsibility, a condition of the very acceptability of the state system
>
> *(VI.1; Risse, 2014)*

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### UNLEGAL: Environmental rule of law: tracking progress and charting future directions

- **Organisation**: UNEP
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because human rights are a core, explicit focus throughout the report as the governance foundation for environmental rule of law, but they are framed for humans (not empowering nonhumans) and are not operationalized to include nonhuman decision-making; under the Paternalism rung, a core use warrants a 2.

- The report makes the human rights–rule of law linkage foundational, repeatedly defining environmental rule of law with reference to consistency with human rights and emphasizing mutual reinforcement: 

> Rule of law describes a governance system in which all persons, including public and private individuals and institutions, are accountable to laws that are public, equally enforced, independently adjudicated and consistent with human rights. UNEP has identified seven core elements of environmental rule of law... Environmental rule of law has a mutually reinforcing relationship with constitutional, human and other rights.
>
> *(Chapter 1, Section 1.2.1; Box 1.1)*


- Human rights are central to multiple chapters (rights, justice, civic engagement), including as an explicit analytical pillar and outcome objective: 

> Rights are among the core components of effective legal systems... Human rights to life, health, property, culture, food, housing and privacy, among others, depend on the quality of the natural environment, and are increasingly used to protect the environment.
>
> *(Chapter 4, Section 4.1)*


- The report takes the UN recognition of the human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment as a key driver and basis for policy and litigation: 

> On 28 July 2022, the UN General Assembly recognized that the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment is a human right... The HRC and General Assembly resolutions are also likely to inform how diverse institutions—including advocates, national courts and human rights mechanisms—approach rights to a healthy environment and their role in environmental rule of law.
>
> *(Chapter 4, Section 4.3.3)*


- It develops implications for implementation (conceptually rather than nonhuman empowerment), including judicial remedies and institutional integration: 

> Invoking rights can provide access to courts... Recognition of rights can create additional pathways for access to justice and open new types of remedies... At the international level, connecting environmental challenges to human rights can open access to human rights mechanisms.
>
> *(Chapter 4, Section 4.1.2)*

#### EUHRPLAN21: Human rights for the planet

- **Organisation**: Council of Europe
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because human rights are the core, explicit focus of the conference and proceedings (paternalism rung), framing environmental protection through the ECHR and related human rights obligations rather than directly empowering nonhumans with agency or standing; the text repeatedly centers human rights as the vehicle for environmental action and discusses expanding human rights instruments to include a healthy environment, but does not operationalize nonhuman empowerment mechanisms.

- The conference frames the environment as essential to human rights and positions ECHR jurisprudence as the main lever: 

> A Clean environment is a precondition to the enjoyment of human rights, as everyone’s rights to life, health, quality private and family life or home, or the right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions, depend on healthy ecosystems, stable climate, as well as on unpolluted air water and soil.
>
> *(Preface)*


- Opening remarks emphasize the human-rights-centric approach to climate and environment: 

> The conference’s focus is not just on the relationship between human rights and the environment, but also on what should be the role of domestic and International courts, including the European Court of Human Rights, in this field.
>
> *(Opening of the conference)*


- The Secretary General of the Council of Europe underscores expanding human rights tools, not nonhuman rights: 

> there is a determination within the Organisation to move forward in a proactive manner, within the boundaries of our mandate. For example, our Steering Committee for Human Rights is looking at the potential for a new recommendation on human rights and the environment.
>
> *(Opening remarks by the Secretary General)*


- Advocate for explicit human right to a healthy environment: 

> I stand by it and reiterate my call for global recognition and effective implementation of the human right to a healthy environment... Adopting a new protocol to the European Convention that explicitly recognizes such a right would be a major step in the right direction.
>
> *(Michelle Bachelet)*

#### EUNATURERIGHTS21: Can nature get it right? Rights of Nature in the European context

- **Organisation**: European Parliament
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the study devotes a full chapter to human rights (ECHR, ECtHR jurisprudence, Aarhus) framing environmental protection through human rights instruments; it evaluates feasibility and limits of a human right to a healthy environment in Europe but does not empower nonhumans directly.

- The study sets out the human-rights lens explicitly: 

> This study... explores... the ideas of rights of nature in comparison with rights to nature, legal personhood and standing in court for natural entities, and analyses ECtHR and CJEU case-law on access to justice in environmental decision-making.
>
> *(Abstract)*


- It outlines the ECHR’s human-rights-based protection and constraints: 

> Environmental protection under the European Convention... is indirect, since the beneficiaries of the duty of the States... are only those individuals whose rights will be affected. Thus, the duty is not about protecting the environment, but of protecting humans from significantly harmful environmental effects.
>
> *(3.9 Interim conclusions on ECHR and Aarhus)*


- It details standing and victim requirements: 

> Going to the Strasbourg court shall only be regarded as a last resort... the Convention has a strong public trigger; any 'victim' – after having exhausted national remedies – can sue the government... However, there is a limitation which excludes those who want to use the Convention for general purposes of environmental protection or nature conservation, the so-called 'direct victim requirement'.
>
> *(3.6 Victims and standing)*

#### IPBESPATHWAYS19: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 5. Realizing a sustainable world for nature and people: transformative strategies, actions and roles for all

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because human rights are explicitly presented as a core legal approach to protect biodiversity (a central focus of Action 1.2), but as a human-centred, shallow-paternalism framework it cannot score 3 or 4; the chapter details implications and mechanisms (e.g., accountability, compliance, rights recognition) but remains anthropocentric.

- The chapter frames human rights as a primary legal lever to enhance biodiversity protection, detailing specific rights and legal effects: 

> Legal protection of biodiversity can be enhanced through the protection of internationally recognized human rights, including the right of every human to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment (Bennett et al., 2024; Knox, 2018b; UNGA, 2022); Indigenous Peoples’ rights (Knox, 2018b; Morgera, 2019; United Nations, 2020); local communities’ rights (De Schutter, 2012; Fakhri, 2024); women’s rights (Boyd, 2023); and children’s rights (Knox, 2018a; Morgera, 2024; Shields et al., 2023; UNCRC, 2023). Legal recognition of these rights can change the perception of the importance of biodiversity for the realization of multiple policy goals... Human-rights approaches provide an existing framework for reducing the disproportionately negative impacts... empowering groups... enhancing compliance with law... and clarifying the accountability of public authorities and private companies.
>
> *(5.3.2)*


- It underscores human rights as essential to transformation in biodiversity governance: 

> Human rights have been increasingly recognized as crucial to support transformation in biodiversity governance (Ituarte-Lima, 2023; Lombard et al., 2022; Morgera, 2024; Switzer et al., 2022; Webster & Morgera, 2021).
>
> *(5.3.2)*


- The chapter links rights recognition to concrete governance mechanisms (participation, accountability): 

> Genuine public participation in governmental processes and targeted collaboration between different affected and responsible stakeholder groups provide opportunities for society to pivot...

 and monitoring/accountability mechanisms are tied to standards like GRI and TNFD for compliance and disclosure. (Exec. summary points 8–9; 5.5.4)

- Although mechanisms are described, they are anchored in human entitlements and responsibilities; hence they remain anthropocentric rather than more-than-human empowerment.

#### CAGENE23: Framing challenges and opportunities for Canada – Expert panel on regulating gene-edited organisms for pest control

- **Organisation**: CCA
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because human rights (including UNDRIP and fundamental freedoms) are explicitly discussed as ethical and governance guardrails, but they are used primarily to set principles and concerns rather than being operationalized with concrete, enforceable mechanisms across governance and practice. - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> There are concerns about the impact on the Rights and autonomy of Indigenous peoples and other equity-deserving groups in Canada. Specifically, gene-edited organisms could spread into Indigenous communities’ local environments without their knowledge or consent, violating inherent rights or Treaty Rights.
>
> *(Chapter 1, A focus on meaningful engagement)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> There are numerous important considerations when engaging Indigenous peoples in pest-management contexts... in agreement with UNDRIP and with consideration for human rights standards and fundamental freedoms in relation to all citizens.
>
> *(Box 1.1; Chapter 2.3)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> The choice of suitable comparators depends on the endpoint being evaluated... Prior to field tests... comparators could be unmodified organisms from the parent line... emerging findings might dictate a range of new endpoints and comparators.
>
> *(Box 4.1; governance of trials aligns with rights-based consent and oversight)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> In considering the potential departures from standard practices... precautionary measures have been set out... inclusivity — namely regarding the consent of local communities and Indigenous peoples (UN CBD, 2018).
>
> *(Chapter 4.3)*

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### UNBOL2023: Plurinational State of Bolivia position on Nature-Based Solutions – UNEP Consultation

- **Organisation**: UNEP
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the document also refers to the rights of Indigenous Peoples and local communities as part of its legal package (anthropocentric justice), but focuses primarily on Mother Earth’s rights as the central legal subject.

- Context/synthesis: The submission recognises and strengthens human rights alongside the Rights of Nature: 

> must recognize the rights of Mother Earth... as well as the rights of Indigenous Peoples and local communities.
>
> *(p.2)*


- Context/synthesis: It details representative empowerment of these human groups in protection and governance of Mother Earth, reinforcing a human-rights dimension: 

> i) Implement actions to strengthen the role of Indigenous Peoples and local communities, women and youth in the protection of Mother Earth.
>
> *(Annex)*

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### UNCITIES21: Global environment outlook for cities – towards green and just cities (GEO for Cities)

- **Organisation**: UNEP & UN-Habitat
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because a rights-based approach for humans is a significant and recurring governance mechanism (Rosario, Seattle DVP), informing decision-making, budgeting and planning, but here it is anthropocentric and positioned as part of inclusive urban justice rather than more-than-human rights.

- Rights-based policy in practice: 

> A rights-based approach to social and environmental challenges has dominated much of the urban discussion... Several cities... have adopted a rights-based approach to articulate environmental sustainability and social equity questions...
>
> *(Chapter 5, 5.5.3)*


- Outcomes and instruments: 

> Participatory budgeting has become a key redistributive mechanism, a rights-based governance instrument, a communication tool and a vehicle for citizenship capacity-building.
>
> *(Chapter 5, Box 5.7, Rosario)*


- Decision-making and inclusion: 

> The Environmental Justice Committee works as a bridge between the city administration and local communities to ensure that environmental actions are meaningful at the local level...
>
> *(Chapter 5, Box 5.6, Seattle DVP)*

#### UNESCOEDU21: Reimagining our futures together: a new social contract for education

- **Organisation**: UNESCO
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because human rights are explicitly the foundational framework for the proposed social contract and anchor many proposals, but they are applied in a human-centric manner (not extended to nonhumans). - The report grounds the social contract in human rights: 

> This new social contract must be grounded in human rights and based on principles of non-discrimination, social justice, respect for life, human dignity and cultural diversity. It must encompass an ethic of care, reciprocity, and solidarity.
>
> *(Executive summary)*

 - It elaborates the right to education throughout life as a basis for policy and curricula: 

> Assuring the right to quality education throughout life. The right to education... must continue to be the foundation of the new social contract... It must also encompass the right to information, culture and science – as well as the right to access and contribute to the knowledge commons.
>
> *(Introduction)*

### IMPLEMENTATION AND METRICS

#### IRELANDAAD22: Southern Regional Assembly 2020 Annual Report

- **Organisation**: Southern Regional Assembly
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because human rights are explicitly mentioned once under the Corporate Plan's Public Sector Duty, but only as a brief statement focused on staff and without further development, mechanisms, or application to more-than-human empowerment.

- The mention of human rights is confined to a brief bullet under Goal 2 (Valuing Our People) and is human-centric, not extended to nonhuman stakeholders: 

> The Members adopted the Assembly’s Corporate Plan 2020-24 in July, which will be delivered under three goals, Regional Leadership, Valuing Our People, and Promoting Sustainable Regional Development. • Public Sector Duty: Ensure we are doing the right things, in the right way, for the people of our region and our employees, in an inclusive, open, and responsible manner, based on the need to eliminate discrimination, promote equality and protect human rights of staff
>
> *(Section 4, Corporate Plan 2020-24)*


- There is no subsequent elaboration on human rights beyond the staff-focused public sector duty and it does not connect to nonhuman beings or more-than-human participation: 

> Goal 2: Valuing Our People • Public Sector Duty: Ensure we are doing the right things, in the right way... and protect human rights of staff
>
> *(Section 4, Corporate Plan 2020-24)*

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### UNLAND17_1: The Global Land Outlook: Part 1 - The Big Picture

- **Organisation**: UNCCD
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because the document explicitly references human rights as a framing for land and biodiversity benefits, but only in passing and in a human-centric way; it is not a core focus nor operationalized for more-than-human empowerment.

- The report links biodiversity and ecosystem services to human rights, framing them as underpinning human entitlements rather than extending rights to nonhumans: 

> In basic terms, there is increasing competition between the demand for goods and services that benefit people, like food, water, and energy, and the need to protect other ecosystem services that regulate and support all life on Earth. Terrestrial biodiversity underpins all of these services and underwrites the full enjoyment of a wide range of human rights, such as the rights to a healthy life, nutritious food, clean water, and cultural identity.
>
> *(Executive Summary, p. 11)*


- Human rights framing appears as a contextual justification, not as a central mechanism or structured agenda for governance change: 

> Ultimately, how can we ignore the moral and ethical obligation to safeguard and preserve the land for future generations?
>
> *(Executive Summary, p. 13)*

#### IPBESTCA2: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 2. Visions of a sustainable world – for nature and people

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because a rights-based approach is explicitly referenced, but only in passing as an outcome category and not developed as a core framework or with mechanisms; it is also human-focused rather than more-than-human.

- Rights language appears as an outcome indicator, signaling inclusion but not substantive engagement or operationalization: 

> Socio-economic outcomes include... 1.14: promotion of a rights-based approach... 1.9: recognition of rights and values, 1.10: Indigenous Peoples and local communities’ inclusion...
>
> *(Figure 2.7 caption)*


- The chapter notes community rights and empowerment as a core theme, again indicating rights discourse without detailed human rights governance design: 

> Theme 2. Community rights and empowerment: advocates for enhancing the capacity of local people to manage their resources, make decisions and shape development trajectories.
>
> *(Figure 2.4 caption)*


- Prevents higher score: rights are not elaborated as a policy framework nor extended to nonhumans in this item; no concrete mechanisms are proposed here.

---

#### IPBESTCA4: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 4. Overcoming the challenges of achieving transformative change

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because human rights language is used in relation to Indigenous Peoples’ rights in examples, but the chapter does not develop a human rights framework or detailed rights-based mechanisms for more-than-human participation. - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> As a reformist approach, biodiversity markets-based mechanisms have been linked to continued dispossession and violations of the rights of Indigenous Peoples, as in the case of the Cordillera Azul National Park (Box 4 .1).
>
> *(4.2.3; Box 4.1)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Such claims are further delegitimized through their association with groups often classified as less capable or deserving of the right to manage the environment... The combination of 'illegitimate' ways of knowing the world and 'inferior' populations serves to reinforce and legitimize the expropriation of natural resources from such groups...
>
> *(4.2.1)*



---

#### EUHORIZON23: Horizon Europe strategic plan 2025–2027 analysis

- **Organisation**: European Commission
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because human rights and related rights frameworks are mentioned (e.g., fundamental rights, digital rights and principles) but only as passing references supporting human-centred digital and policy aims; they are not developed as a core focus, nor applied in a more-than-human way.

- The digital rights articulation is cited to guide human-centric transformation: 

> Through the declaration on digital rights and principles, which the Commission proposed in January 2022, the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament signed up to a common approach for a human-centred digital transformation that Europe promotes and defends across the world.
>
> *(Section 1.2 – Geopolitical nature)*


- Science-for-policy section frames the need to respect fundamental rights in evidence-based policymaking: 

> These principles are why the Commission has put scientific evidence at the heart of its policymaking processes... drawing on insights from research and scholarship, and taking European values and respect for fundamental rights as critical guidelines.
>
> *(Section 1.3 – Box 1)*


- The uses remain anthropocentric and auxiliary to digital and governance goals; there is no extension to nonhuman rights or legal standing.

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### ISCHEALTH21: Urban health and wellbeing in the Anthropocene: interdisciplinary science-action plan 2021–2025

- **Organisation**: ISC/ISUH/IAP
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because human rights are only mentioned briefly as part of a broader principle set (Xiamen Call for Action) rather than being a core or operational framework in the plan, and the use remains human-centric. - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: The report references human rights under an inclusiveness principle within the Xiamen Call for Action, but does not develop mechanisms that would extend rights to nonhumans or operationalize human rights to explicitly empower more-than-human agents: 

> Governing urban complexity to secure the health and wellbeing of cities, as reconfirmed by the scientific committee of the UHWB programme, can be facilitated by adhering to the principles outlined in the Xiamen Call for Action: 1. Clear leadership and mandate to deal with urban health issues in an integrated manner. 2. Inclusiveness: including human rights; mutually beneficial for sectors. 3. Inter-sectorality... 4. Health and wellbeing as performance indicators... 5. Risk sharing... 6. Pre-cautionary principle...
