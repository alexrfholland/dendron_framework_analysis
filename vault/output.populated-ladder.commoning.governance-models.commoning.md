# Commoning

## Score 4: Actionable Mechanisms

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### SCTRANSS25: Environment strategy for Scotland – transformative changes for sustainability

- **Organisation**: Scottish Government
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because commoning is advanced with detailed, actionable mechanisms (supportive legal frameworks, procurement, governance, finance, IP reform), and concrete steps for government to enable commons-based economic and conservation practices.

- The report lists clear enabling instruments for commoning, including legal, financial, governance and digital infrastructure supports: 

> Supportive policy actions are needed to support commoning (Bollier, 2020): - supportive legal frameworks - intellectual property reform - governance - supportive economic models e.g. community-supported agriculture and cooperatives - digital platforms using open source software and education.
>
> *(Box 5: Support for commoning)*


- It ties commoning to public procurement and territorial approaches, specifying scaling strategies and success criteria: 

> Support ‘commoning’ policy levers... (e.g. public procurement, public-community partnerships, non-speculative community currency and credit approaches)... Supporting territorial / biocultural region approaches that support autonomous regeneration...
>
> *(Table 3: Economic levers; Social & cultural instruments)*


- The report connects commoning to nonhuman empowerment outcomes (autonomy, solidarity, regenerative relationships), clarifying goals and evaluation: 

> Promote assessment of wellbeing (human, non-human) in national indicators, foregrounding indicators such as autonomy and solidarity... place-based autonomous regeneration of all life.
>
> *(Table 3)*


- It recognises and addresses power constraints (corporate concentration) with anti-monopoly and ownership reforms to create space for commons: 

> Legal measures to tackle large corporate concentration such as anti-monopoly regulation... Spreading the ownership of wealth... public ownership... cooperatives.
>
> *(Table 3; 7.1 Economic instruments)*

## Score 3: Core Conceptual Device / Implications Explored

### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### UNESCOEDU20: Learning to become with the world: education for future survival

- **Organisation**: Common Worlds/UNESCO
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Humanities/Ethics

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because commoning is explicitly proposed as the process by which humans and Earth others sustain shared worlds over time, used as a core conceptual destination for education; the paper explores implications and outcomes but does not provide operational policy design. - The text names commoning as the enabling process of more-than-human governance: 

> It has become clear that the answer to this question can only be enacted through the process of commoning: of humans becoming with Earth others, as we all recompose worlds together (Haraway, 2016).
>
> *(Visionary declarations, 7)*

 - It situates education in ‘common worlds’ and explains how these are co-composed with nonhumans: 

> We have resituated the practice of education in common worlds because we no longer differentiate between the social and the environmental, and no longer frame pedagogy as an exclusively human activity.
>
> *(Visionary declarations, 7)*

 - It uses cosmopolitics to describe assembling common worlds across communities: 

> This gave us the opportunity to learn and practice ‘articulations’ among multiple, divergent worlds... common worlds do not pre-exist their articulations but need to be ‘slowly composed’ in the presence of others, both human and more than human.
>
> *(Visionary declarations, 6)*

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### EIVIS23: Exploring new visions for a sustainable bioeconomy

- **Organisation**: JRC, EC
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the report explicitly recommends promoting commons as a governance approach, links it to open, shared technologies and knowledge (e.g., farm-free food), and develops implications for policy and monitoring, though it lacks a full institutional design. - Context/synthesis: Commoning is named in governance implications, recommending support and promotion of commons for material and immaterial goods. 

> Commons: A green and just bioeconomy would support and promote commons both for material and immaterial goods.
>
> *(p. 43)*


- Context/synthesis: It derives consequences for technological governance to avoid enclosure, advocating openness in foundational technologies that would enable nonhuman-positive outcomes via land sparing. 

> Monbiot’s call for farm-free food... comes with a warning that new technologies should be as much as possible openly available.
>
> *(p. 43)*


- Context/synthesis: The monitoring section anticipates qualitative treatment of justice and equity—including commons—as part of the revised BMS compass, indicating criteria for success. 

> It will be important therefore to consider whether these issues are best tackled through inclusion into the quantitative... or rather as a separate qualitative exercise, where less tangible issues can be captured.
>
> *(p. 42)*

## Score 2: Theoretical Treatment

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### EUSTI50: S&T&I for 2050: science, technology and innovation for ecosystem performance – accelerating sustainability transitions

- **Organisation**: EC DG R&I
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report references commons governance (e.g., Ostrom's design principles) and commons-based land use under scenario P3, but does not develop a full institutional blueprint for sustained multispecies commoning.

- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> The governance framework for land use negotiations in this scenario is provided by the notion of multi species justice on the one hand and Elinor Ostrom's design principles for governing common resources on the other.
>
> *(4.2.3 Land use adapting to nature – Scenario P3)*


- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> P3 [Implications]... Commons based land use practices... Environmental health (psychological health) ... Communication with other forms of life ... International networks for knowledge exchange on localised practices.
>
> *(Table 5: STI Directions vis‑à‑vis three scenario approaches)*

#### TNBEYOND24: Analysing the beyond growth debate

- **Organisation**: TNO Publiek
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because commoning is discussed in The Great Mindshift and Buen Vivir sections as part of systemic transformations and governance alternatives, but as a literature review without specific policy design by the authors.

- The review highlights commoning as a transformation pathway: 

> The Commoning movement works on changing governance systems towards adopting communing or sharing principles...
>
> *(A.6.4)*


- It notes commoning’s role in community-based property under Buen Vivir and the need for plural transition strategies, indicating implications for practice: 

> This would include: rights for nature, community-based property, economic sovereignty...
>
> *(A.7.4)*
