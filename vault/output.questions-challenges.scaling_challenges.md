# SCALING_CHALLENGES: Scaling challenges

## Sources and Questions

### UNLAND17_3: The Global Land Outlook: Part 3 - A More Secure Future

**Question**: How can successful local or pilot sustainable land management practices be scaled to landscape and national levels, given that projects rarely plan for scaling and face systemic barriers?

**Evidence**: “Despite decades of research and work on sustainable land management, the evidence and analysis presented in this Outlook show that we are still losing ground in terms of global land health and productivity. This is far from inevitable: many examples of successful management exist. Yet the multitude of small-scale projects has not substantially translated into large-scale adoption.” (Part Three – Response 6: Creating an enabling environment)
“There is a lot of talk about the need to scale up best practices in sustainable land management, but projects rarely plan a scaling-up strategy. Tools are available including scale considerations in the design and planning phase, the use of peer-to-peer learning, and information dissemination through local modes of communication, but most often the financing for these types of activities is lacking.” (Part Three – Box 17/Response 6)

### ICNATUREPOS24: Blueprint for a Nature-Positive Adelaide

**Question**: What mechanisms enable opportunistic, site-based BSUD actions to scale into coordinated metropolitan biodiversity networks?

**Evidence**: “BSUD is often opportunistic... more strategic planning for BSUD would enable actions to be prioritised, leading to more optimal outcomes for biodiversity, and would enable projects across property boundaries to complement each other, enhancing landscape connectivity.” (Section 6.4)

### UNCITIES21: Global environment outlook for cities – towards green and just cities (GEO for Cities)

**Question**: How can pilot projects and localized innovations in multispecies and resilience planning be institutionalized and scaled without losing contextual effectiveness?

**Evidence**: “For pilot projects to contribute to these transformations and shift ‘business as usual’ thinking and approaches, ‘they must, at some point, move beyond the initial test site or boundaries within which they were created’ (Hughes, Yordi and Besco 2020).” (Chapter 2, 2.4.3)
“Effective institutionalization or mainstreaming of change at the city scale has also required shifts in policy, in procedures, shifts in methodologies and ways of doing things, as well as staff development.” (Chapter 2, 2.4.3)

### SCTRANSS25: Environment strategy for Scotland – transformative changes for sustainability

**Question**: What mechanisms allow place-based, autonomous regeneration and commons to scale without dilution by national and global political economies?

**Evidence**: “Place-based governance interventions are extremely valuable, but are not able to adequately challenge structures at the global scale and unaccountable corporate and high net worth individual impacts... Deep leverage points... require more than national government policy levers... changes in the nature of the state and the nature and organisation of its politics and economies.” (3.1 Sustainability sciences; Executive Summary)

### UNLAND17_1: The Global Land Outlook: Part 1 - The Big Picture

**Question**: What enabling conditions are needed to scale successful local land management practices into transformative, landscape-scale initiatives?

**Evidence**: 

> Creating an enabling environment: providing the conditions necessary to scale local successes into large-scale, transformative initiatives. This includes fostering the underlying social and economic conditions and institutions… stakeholder engagement, land tenure, gender equality, and the availability of sustained investment and infrastructure.
>
> *(Executive Summary, Part Three: A More Secure Future, p. 13)*

### IPBESTCA3: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 3. How transformative change occurs

**Question**: What mechanisms allow local transformations (e.g., legal personhood cases) to scale without losing contextual effectiveness?

**Evidence**: “A global transformation... will be composed of multiple interacting pathways and a mosaic of initiatives... Spatial, temporal and socio-political scales are all intertwined... Efforts at different scales can reinforce and amplify one another if aligned, or can work against one another if not.” (Executive summary point 8, p. 107)

### EUINVASIVE24: IPBES Invasive Alien Species Assessment: Chapter 1. Introducing Biological Invasions and the IPBES Thematic Assessment of Invasive Alien Species and Their Control

**Question**: What mechanisms allow insights on IAS drivers and impacts from local studies to scale across spatial and temporal levels without losing contextual effectiveness?

**Evidence**: - Context/synthesis: The assessment emphasizes the difficulties of scaling mechanisms and inferring processes across scales and time. “Understanding the process of biological invasions within the context of varying spatial and temporal scales is important but can be challenging... most mechanistic studies only look at short periods of time... Simple scaling up is of limited value because processes and mechanisms vary at different scales...” (Section 1.5)

- Context/synthesis: It highlights the need for multiscale solutions and long-term datasets. “However... macroecological studies are filling some of these gaps... Multiscale solutions can help to address the threats posed to the natural world by multiple drivers of change in nature.” (Section 1.5)

### UNPLANETBOUND22: Thematic study: planetary boundaries

**Question**: How can planetary boundaries be translated into fair national shares and cascaded to regions and communities with robust allocation principles?

**Evidence**: “In order to ensure significant practical application, the planetary boundaries must be translated and operationalised to match the scale and levels where most governance decisions are made... Of particular importance is the need to develop robust allocation principles to ensure the fair share of the safe operating space.” (Part 2.3.2, Priority for Action 2, Message 2.1)

---

### EUONEHEALTH24: One Health governance in the European Union

**Question**: What mechanisms allow local/transdisciplinary One Health solutions to scale to EU-level policy without losing contextual effectiveness?

**Evidence**: “To make use of transdisciplinary insights, we must address questions of scaling. Sustainable environmental management works well in small scale communities; how can it be done at the EU level?” (One Health definition – Interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary collaboration)
“Costs and benefits will depend on the context, so they need to be assessed in various settings; making fair comparisons is difficult.” (Executive summary – Leverage points)

---

### TNBEYOND24: Analysing the beyond growth debate

**Question**: What scaling mechanisms can translate local or conceptual alternatives (degrowth, Buen Vivir, commoning) into national/international implementation without co-option?

**Evidence**: “Degrowth is ambiguous in its way of scaling from first initiative to global implementation... while bottom-up action... the main actual changes proposed... will have to be implemented top-down by governments.” (A.5.4)
“Buen vivir... How could buen vivir overcome existing dominating power structures in the phase of transition and upscaling?” (A.7.5)

---

### IPBESTCA4: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 4. Overcoming the challenges of achieving transformative change

**Question**: How can legal and governance mechanisms contend with telecouplings that cross jurisdictions and scales while ensuring accountability for biodiversity impacts?

**Evidence**: “Telecouplings... present challenges to legal/regulatory avenues for transformative change when they cross different jurisdictions and legal systems that may disagree about the responsibility or liability of actors for harm.” (4.2.4; Table 4.1)

### CAGENE23: Framing challenges and opportunities for Canada – Expert panel on regulating gene-edited organisms for pest control

**Question**: What governance structures are needed to coordinate area-wide and cross-border pest control with gene-edited organisms?

**Evidence**: 

> Ecological zones do not map neatly onto geopolitical authority structures... A lack of experience risks a lack of preparedness... Close partnerships with the United States will be crucial to build Canadian capacity.
>
> *(Message from the Chair; Chapter 6.2)*



---

### EUHORIZON23: Horizon Europe strategic plan 2025–2027 analysis

**Question**: What infrastructures and management systems enable successful local commons and nature-based solutions to scale responsibly?

**Evidence**: “The legal recognition of global commons emphasises the importance of scaling up well-performing local models of commons management... upscaling from local to global governance of commons – infrastructures and management systems.” (Box 10 – Priority areas for EU R&I – global commons; Section 1.4.2)

---

### IPBESMODELS46: Report of the IPBES task force on scenarios and models – Nature Futures Scenarios

**Question**: How can we link local subnational scenarios to global dynamics, including telecoupling and cross-scale feedbacks?

**Evidence**: “Cross-scale linkages: The scale of analysis depends on the problem at hand… global scenarios should be developed as an accumulation of local scenarios… However, it was noted that it would be difficult for sub-global case studies to account for teleconnections and telecoupling.” (II.d)

---

### LANCETFOOD19: Food in the Anthropocene: the EAT–Lancet Commission on healthy diets from sustainable food systems

**Question**: What mechanisms allow an unprecedented, multi-level Great Food Transformation to scale from global targets to national and local action without losing effectiveness?

**Evidence**: “Humanity has never aimed to change the global food system on the scale envisioned in this Commission; this objective is uncharted policy territory and the problems outlined in this Commission are not easily fixed.” (Executive summary)
“Because these goals cross-cut political, sectoral, and geographical boundaries, an integrated approach is needed… Integrated approaches can be advanced by establishing formal and frequent interactions between governing groups.” (Section 4)

---

### COMESTWATER22: Report of COMEST on water ethics: ocean, freshwater and coastal areas

**Question**: How should protection or use balance at different scales (e.g., MPAs vs. global protection) be designed to address interconnected ocean systems?

**Evidence**: “There are several ethical dilemmas associated with the designation of MPAs… proposals for declaring MPAs covering as much as 10%, 30% or more of the world ocean area beg the question of whether such approach is feasible… or whether it is more appropriate to protect the entire ocean with global rules and regulation.” (II.4 Case Study 1: The Global Ocean)

---

### D4C25: Design for Environmental Conservation (Toolkit)

**Question**: How can local, place-based multispecies solutions scale without losing contextual integrity (Agile-to-Deep)?

**Evidence**: “We cannot afford to wait for a unified global response… demands immediate, decentralized action… While small on their own, these myriad efforts collectively coalesce into broader systemic change… Agile-to-Deep pathway enables users to start with a manageable design-thinking process and gradually deepen their efforts.” (Ch.1; Ch.5; Ch.11)

---

### IUCNWILD16: Wilderness protected areas: management guidelines for IUCN Category 1b protected areas

**Question**: Managing wilderness in relation to adjacent lands and achieving landscape connectivity is difficult.

**Evidence**: “It is often necessary to manage the wilderness area not in isolation but in coordination with its adjacent lands... Boundaries cannot always be established in a way that limits exchange of organisms, sounds, water and human uses across landscapes.” (2.11)

---

### PBLNATUREPOS22: Exploring nature-positive pathways: contribution to CBD Post-2020 GBF

**Question**: How can bottom-up, place-based nature-positive initiatives be supported and scaled without losing context effectiveness?

**Evidence**: “The CBD could build on this ‘groundswell of action’ to strengthen future implementation… However, there are barriers to scaling up these bottom-up efforts, such as a lack of both recognition and adequate governmental policies to support these initiatives.” (p. 8–9)
