# INSTIT_GAPS: Institutional gaps

## Sources and Questions

### UNLAND17_3: The Global Land Outlook: Part 3 - A More Secure Future

**Question**: What new or reconfigured policies, legislation, institutions, and governance mechanisms are needed to enable integrated landscape approaches and secure land tenure for equitable, sustainable land use?

**Evidence**: “In many countries, implementing a landscape approach will require new or changes to existing policies, legislation, and regulation, and the adoption of appropriate instruments and institutions to support integrated management planning for soil, water, and biodiversity resources.” (Part Three – Response 1: Multifunctional landscapes)
“Weak governance of tenure is a major constraint in planning for and achieving sustainable development; it can lead to land degradation and exacerbate conflicts over the use of land resources. Conversely, secure resource rights and land tenure contributes to the uptake of sustainable land management practices.” (Part Three – Response 6: Enabling environment)

### ICNATUREPOS24: Blueprint for a Nature-Positive Adelaide

**Question**: Which legislative reforms are required to better protect remnant vegetation and significant trees in metropolitan contexts?

**Evidence**: “There has been much discussion... about whether South Australia’s tree protection laws are strong enough... the following reviews are underway: Open Space and Tree Review... Planning System Implementation Review... Inquiry into the Urban Forest... Green Adelaide... have made submissions outlining the opportunities and challenges of this legislation...” (Section 7.1)

---

### UNCITIES21: Global environment outlook for cities – towards green and just cities (GEO for Cities)

**Question**: How can cities resolve fragmented, under-resourced, and multi-level governance misalignments that block inclusive, multispecies environmental action?

**Evidence**: “Cities are complex systems of interdependencies... They are governed by a broad spectrum of institutions and policy instruments from local to national levels... In many places, even if cities want to take positive action, unfavourable and centralized national policies can lock in environmentally unsustainable business-as-usual pathways at the local level.” (Chapter 2, 2.3.3)
“Most urban local governments are underfunded... This fiscal dependence brings constraints... Access to financing remains a critical factor to enable cities to implement these global goals on the ground...” (Chapter 2, 2.3.3)

---

### SCTRANSS25: Environment strategy for Scotland – transformative changes for sustainability

**Question**: What institutional innovations are required to give nonhuman actors an active political voice (guardianship, ombudspersons, deliberative bodies) and ensure legal enforceability?

**Evidence**: “Making effective use of all four lenses requires governance structures that give equal weight to all lenses... [and] enable dialogue... Create changes in the justice system... support Rights of Nature... legal guardians... transparency and accountability mechanisms... environmental ombudspersons to enable public access to relevant information.” (UKHYDRO22 echoed; Table 3 Legal and regulatory instruments)

---

### EUCLIM24: Towards sustainable transformation: research priorities in climate change and biodiversity

**Question**: What are the opportunities and challenges for transboundary collaboration on biodiversity protection and climate action?

**Evidence**: 

> Effective action on biodiversity loss and climate will require greatly increased international collaboration and governance... no research has been undertaken at a global level to determine the state of, opportunities for, and challenges for terrestrial transboundary conservation.
>
> *(Section 4.3)*



---

### TWITRANS18: Transformations to achieve the sustainable development goals

**Question**: What new institutional capacities and structures are needed to govern integrated transformations across sectors and scales?

**Evidence**: “Current governance models and arrangements, whether global, regional, national or institutional, are ill-suited to develop, oversee or implement truly integrated, multi-dimensional sustainable development agendas such as proposed by the SDGs.” (Key Messages #7)
“It becomes very clear, that the six major transformations require governance structures and capabilities, political action and the formation of actors of change on local, national and global levels… Taking the 2030 Agenda seriously implies that incremental change is no option, transformative governance is needed.” (Putting governance, values and policy tools into the center)

---

### STOCK50: Stockholm+50: unlocking a better future

**Question**: How can policy mixes and multilateral institutions be reshaped to overcome fragmentation, weak mandates, and coherence failures that block ambitious environmental action?

**Evidence**:  

> The structural barriers of policy incoherence, weak multilateralism and lack of accountability must be decisively tackled to enable effective action... Governments and international organizations should only use integrated and systemic approaches to policymaking.
>
> *(Improving conditions for change)*



---

### UNLAND17_2: The Global Land Outlook: Part 2 - The Outlook

**Question**: How can multi-level land and water governance systems be strengthened to coordinate across sectors and scales, including tenure security, to prevent degradation and enable sustainable transitions?

**Evidence**: 

> Response pathways (see Part Three) need to help alleviate land pressures and achieve a more equitable balance between environmental and socio-economic trade-offs... Land governance at the local, national and international scale coupled with enlightened land use planning and land management systems will be essential to navigate such a transition.
>
> *(Chapter 6, Conclusion)*

> Strengthening governance of tenure is fundamental for the increased uptake of sustainable land management practices... securing tenure frequently requires innovative solutions that reconcile statutory law and customary rights.
>
> *(Chapter 12, 4. Policy incentives)*



---

### UNLAND17_1: The Global Land Outlook: Part 1 - The Big Picture

**Question**: How can countries establish and enforce equitable land tenure systems where laws are inadequate or poorly implemented?

**Evidence**: 

> Many developing countries lack adequate laws, or fail to implement established provisions that legally determine who owns the land and its resources. This can lead to default ownership by the state, powerful individuals, or corporations.
>
> *(Chapter 1, Meaning of Land, p. 23)*

> While there is a general consensus on the need to redistribute land in many countries, there is often controversy about how to do so peacefully, equitably, and legally, without invoking rampant corruption, political interference, rent seeking, or social conflict.
>
> *(Chapter 5, Land Resources and Human Security, p. 82)*



---

### EUSTI50: S&T&I for 2050: science, technology and innovation for ecosystem performance – accelerating sustainability transitions

**Question**: Lack of shared institutional structures to represent nonhuman interests (e.g., ombudspersons, guardianships) and to enforce nature’s rights.

**Evidence**: “Strengthening environmental liability and enforcement statutes... establishing Environmental Ombudspersons at the EU and national levels capable and in separate institutions to bring environmental cases to court... establishing an independent administrative body charged with addressing conflicts of interest between 'short-term economic development and environmental protection'.” (4.1.2 Benefits of a RoN approach)
“Such recommendations also reference the potential need to establish an Environmental Ombudsperson at the EU and national levels.” (4.1.5 Implications for STI Policy)

---

### DWILD20: Designing wildlife-inclusive cities

**Question**: How can planning institutions raise biodiversity priority and align sectoral disciplines to enable wildlife-inclusive design in dense, built-up areas?

**Evidence**: “biodiversity is frequently addressed in urban green infrastructure plans, it often is not an integral topic in city planning, urban design and housing development… wildlife-rich urban green is often lacking in those parts of the cities where people live and work.” (1. Introduction)
“planning disciplines are diverse… different objectives and methodologies… integrated approaches are applied… wildlife-inclusive urban design focusses on project-based planning and implies that interdisciplinary teams… also explicitly [focus] on the needs of wildlife.” (2. Urban planning and the concept)

---

### EUECOSERVG2021: Ecosystem services accounting – part III

**Question**: How should ecosystem accounting frameworks institutionalize new types of users (e.g., polluters, ecosystems themselves, and global society) when guidance and consensus are lacking?

**Evidence**: “With regard to the allocation to users, sink services directly depend on polluters’ actions. This issue, although greatly debated, has not been directly addressed in official ecosystem accounting guidelines. We propose an approach here for how to proceed in cases of absorption rates being exceeded; however, the role of polluters is still very controversial and at the moment there is no agreement on how to deal with this issue.” (Chapter 2.5)
“ESs such as carbon sequestration and habitat and species maintenance will need to be structured differently from other ESs because their users cannot be geographically located. On this matter, INCA proposes ‘global society’ as an additional economic unit in the use table. This is different from SEEA EA, which allocates these ES flows to ‘government’. Global ecological public goods in ecosystem accounting will need to be discussed; what we propose here is one contribution to the unavoidable debate on this issue.” (Chapter 2.5)

---

### UNLEGAL: Environmental rule of law: tracking progress and charting future directions

**Question**: What institutional interfaces are needed to systematically connect fast-changing technologies with environmental policy and enforcement demands?

**Evidence**: “Technology is changing at a rapid pace… Collaboration between the technology sector and environmental policymakers and enforcement agencies is largely ad hoc… More systematic engagement could help optimize utilization of current technology… This engagement could follow the example of successful science-policy interfaces… An environmental rule of law technology-policy interface could provide a forum and platform for information exchange and cooperation…” (Chapter 6, Section 6.2.4)

---

### UNPLANETBOUND22: Thematic study: planetary boundaries

**Question**: What governance reforms are needed to move beyond Holocene-era assumptions and manage interacting planetary boundaries?

**Evidence**: “The sheer complexity of global catastrophic risk is overwhelming conventional environmental governance systems, which were originally designed to address incremental environmental change, rather than non-linear processes and the complex interactions between planetary boundaries... global environmental governance must discard outdated assumptions of Holocene stability, and instead embrace complexity, instability and unpredictability as the new normal.” (Part 2.3.2, Priority for Action 2; Part 1.2)

---

### EUHRPLAN21: Human rights for the planet

**Question**: What institutional reforms are needed for the ECHR system to recognize a substantive right to a healthy environment or broader standing to protect nature?

**Evidence**: “As it is well known, the European Convention on Human Rights or its Protocols do not guarantee a substantive right to a healthy environment.” (Overview of ECtHR environmental case-law)
“Public-interest litigation (actio popularis) is excluded from the jurisdiction of the Court... It is therefore clear that, as things stand now, natural or legal persons who pursue their duty to protect the natural environment... have no substantive right to rely on before the Court.” (Standing – Overview of ECtHR environmental case-law)
“Do we need a new Protocol to the European Convention on the Protection of the Environment?” (Opening – Judge Sicilianos)

---

### EUNATURERIGHTS21: Can nature get it right? Rights of Nature in the European context

**Question**: What EU primary-law reforms are needed to embed principles like intrinsic value of biodiversity, ecological integrity, and non-regression?

**Evidence**: “What is lacking on a constitutional level in comparison with ideas of RoN is a general principle of non-regression... Other principles mentioned are those concerning environmental or ecological integrity... a general recognition of the intrinsic value of biodiversity.” (5.3 Substantive or procedural aspects)
“1. The introduction of new environmental principles in EU primary law – ... principles concerning environmental or ecological integrity, as well as a general recognition of the intrinsic value of biodiversity.” (6. Summary of Proposals)

---

### EUONEHEALTH24: One Health governance in the European Union

**Question**: What institutional structures are needed to sustain inter- and transdisciplinary One Health collaboration across EU and member states?

**Evidence**: “There is a lack of institutions designed around inter- and transdisciplinary collaboration. This situation will be gradually improved over the process of implementing One Health.” (One Health definition – Interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary collaboration)
“Knowledge-brokering organisations... sit at such interfaces... their influence... depends on political, financial and institutional will... in the absence of ethical governance processes... could also inadvertently... exclusion of some forms of evidence.” (EU policies – Knowledge-brokering organisations)

---

### TNBEYOND24: Analysing the beyond growth debate

**Question**: Which institutional reforms are needed to move from mission rhetoric to behavioural and structural changes across public and private sectors?

**Evidence**: “How will behavioural change or societal innovation take place in a mission economy? Its importance is mentioned... yet it is largely not elaborated upon.” (A.3.5)
“Many mission-oriented policies have not led to great outcomes... some missions have even had destructive effects...” (A.3.5)

---

### IPBESTCA4: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 4. Overcoming the challenges of achieving transformative change

**Question**: What institutional misfits and accountability gaps limit effective biodiversity governance and how can they be addressed?

**Evidence**: “Institutions that do not account for nor fit the dynamics and magnitude of biodiversity-related problems limit the effectiveness of actions for transformative change (well established).” (Executive Summary point 4)
“Spatial, temporal and social institutional misfits limit opportunities for dealing with biodiversity loss and hamper the effectiveness of biodiversity-focused policies and practices… For example… spatial misfits were identified between water policy implementation and the relevant water quality areas.” (4.2.3; Figure 4.6)

---

### IPBESPATHWAYS19: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 5. Realizing a sustainable world for nature and people: transformative strategies, actions and roles for all

**Question**: What institutional configurations enable integrated policies and accountability for biodiversity governance across levels?

**Evidence**: 

> Insights on underlying institutional configurations that enable integrated policies: Analysis of institutional settings and power structures are needed to understand barriers to integration of biodiversity into sector policies and governance processes... Accountability and reflexive governance in multi-level, multi-actor settings: There are gaps in knowledge associated with adaptive learning processes and administrative entrepreneurship in complex governance structures...
>
> *(Box 5.3)*



---

### CAGENE23: Framing challenges and opportunities for Canada – Expert panel on regulating gene-edited organisms for pest control

**Question**: How can regulatory clarity be achieved across overlapping federal, provincial/territorial, and Indigenous jurisdictions?

**Evidence**: 

> The state of preparedness of the current regulatory landscape for gene-edited organisms in Canada is currently low... The governance of these technologies will require the federal government to work closely with provincial and territorial counterparts, regional and municipal actors, and Indigenous Rights-holders.
>
> *(Chapter 6.1)*



---

### EUHORIZON23: Horizon Europe strategic plan 2025–2027 analysis

**Question**: How can synergies and downstream pathways between Horizon Europe and other EU funds be systematised to mainstream nature-positive outcomes?

**Evidence**: “Building on the experience of Horizon 2020, the potential for the roll-out and deployment of the results of the new framework programme through other EU programmes is still high... only a limited share of Horizon 2020 projects were linked to EU initiative projects beyond the framework... lack of more downstream synergies as a missed opportunity for translating R&I results into practice.” (Section 4.3 – Synergies between Horizon Europe and other EU funds; Box 15)

---

### SIPSECURITY21: Anthropocene (in)securities: reflections on collective survival 50 years after Stockholm

**Question**: What institutional transformations are needed when pollution-control paradigms and traditional security institutions cannot contain systemic biosphere disruption?

**Evidence**:  

> Environmental regulation based on pollution control cannot effectively address the systematic disruption of the global biosphere... Current institutions and modes of environmental regulation fail to grapple with the historical legacy of exploitation...
>
> *(Afterword – Trajectories for security)*



---

### EUTRANS24: Mapping ERC frontier research: addressing climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution

**Question**: What institutional reforms and legal frameworks (e.g., non-extractive law, ecosystem accounting, urban governance) are needed to realign incentives and scale solutions?

**Evidence**:  

> N‑EXTLAW theorises that by creating an appropriate legal framework, non-extractive and sustainable economic activities can be promoted... provide ready-made legal forms... remove obstacles for financial institutions... public procurement... national agencies for social economy...
>
> *(4.1)*

> Ecospace... mapping and accounting for ecosystem services... aligned with the System of Environmental Economic Accounting - Ecosystem Accounting... support developing ‘natural capital accounts’.
>
> *(2.3 Finance and taxation)*



---

### PBLCITIES21: Realising the Urban Opportunity: Cities and the Post-2020 Biodiversity Governance

**Question**: How can the Global Biodiversity Framework fully harness urban capacities beyond narrow planning roles?

**Evidence**: “Yet, we suggest that, despite the growing rhetoric of including ‘all levels of government’ in the GBF, the nature and envisaged potential scope of the role of cities is currently too narrowly drawn, such that it may fail to harness urban capacities for a transformative approach to biodiversity governance.” (Introduction)

---

### GEAURBANGREEN23: Tackling the Climate and Biodiversity Crises in Europe through Urban Greening Plans

**Question**: What institutional and regulatory structures are missing to enable effective, biodiversity-positive urban greening across governance levels?

**Evidence**: - Context/synthesis: The report explicitly identifies a lack of binding regulatory frameworks and unclear mandates across governance levels as a core barrier to effective Urban Greening Plans (UGP). 

> Lack of binding long-term regulatory frameworks and legislation (such as the legally binding nature restoration targets) which require compliance across all government levels; Absence of a governance framework with clear responsibilities and mandates across EU, national, regional and local level to engender accountability, and with it, consistent execution of measures and transparency;
>
> *(Annex II, Table 1)*


- Context/synthesis: It also notes insufficient coordinated decision-making and siloed municipal structures. 

> Lack of coordinated decision-making at city level and collaboration across governance levels, including sub-national, regional, national and EU level, to co-develop mutually reinforcing objectives across scales; ... Due to the sectoral organisation of municipal administration, cross-cutting issues are not effectively addressed...
>
> *(Annex II, Table 1)*



---

### EUDOLPHIN15: Dolphinaria - A Review of the Keeping of Whales and Dolphins in Captivity in the European Union and EC Directive 1999/22, Relating to the Keeping of Wild Animals in Zoos

**Question**: How do exemptions and inconsistent inclusion of dolphinaria under EU zoo regulation undermine welfare and conservation obligations for captive cetaceans?

**Evidence**: - Context/synthesis: The report highlights that Bulgaria exempted dolphinaria from the Zoos Directive by classifying them as circuses, undermining protection. “Bulgaria is the only EU Member State to have exempted dolphinaria from the requirements of EC Directive 1999/22. Dolphinaria are instead regulated by legislation for circuses and theatrical performances.” (Summary; The EU Zoos Directive and dolphinaria in the EU)

- Context/synthesis: It argues such exemptions jeopardize Directive objectives and remove the only protective mechanism for captive cetaceans. “Exempting dolphinaria... jeopardises the Directive’s objectives... By exempting facilities holding cetaceans, Member States are violating the Directive and removing the only mechanism available to protect these wild animals when they are in captivity.” (The EU Zoos Directive and dolphinaria in the EU)

---

### NZOCEAN21: The breaking wave: reforming the oceans management system in Aotearoa New Zealand

**Question**: Fragmented legislation and institutional arrangements create leadership vacuums and hinder coherent, multispecies governance.

**Evidence**: “The existing system is highly fragmented across legislation and institutions that have different processes, purposes and mandates and do not connect well to each other... Overlaps can lead to paralysis, because no agency is obviously in charge of addressing the issue.” (Chapter 3.3)
“There is arguably a vacuum of leadership where agencies struggle to work together or simply assume that responsibility lies elsewhere... we have a strong assumption that those responsible will choose to use the mechanisms available.” (Chapter 3.3)

---

### EURIGHTS: Towards an EU Charter of the Fundamental Rights of Nature

**Question**: At supranational and EU levels, what legal structures and institutions are missing to recognize and enforce Rights of Nature and nonhuman participation?

**Evidence**: “At supranational or international level, there are no legal documents for the recognition of Rights of Nature mainly because the recognition of Nature as a rights holder has always been hindered by the principle of ‘State sovereignty over natural resources’... Nevertheless, there are currently some interesting ideas... aimed at recognizing a common supranational protection between human rights and a healthy environment.” (Section 2.1.1, p. 17-18)

---

### UKHYDRO22: Written evidence (LUE0078) to the Land Use in England Committee inquiry

**Question**: How to equip local planning authorities with ecological expertise to evaluate biodiversity impacts and mitigation proposals?

**Evidence**: “Yet many local authorities do not have in-house ecologists and/or lack access to ecological expertise. Lack of officers with the necessary ecological expertise will make it extremely difficult for local authorities to review proposed mitigation actions, risking biodiversity losses...” (Q10 Response)

---

### IPANP24: The Undemocratic Origins Of The Nature Positive Plan

**Question**: Soft-law biodiversity commitments lack domestic democratic scrutiny and institutional pathways for accountability.

**Evidence**: “These agreements and frameworks are not scrutinised because they do not meet the technical definition of a treaty. However, these instruments of ‘soft law’ are invoked to justify policy developments in the same way as treaties. ‘Soft law’ instruments must be subject to the same scrutiny as treaties.” (Executive summary)

---

### UNBOL2023: Plurinational State of Bolivia position on Nature-Based Solutions – UNEP Consultation

**Question**: What UNEA processes and resolutions are needed to complement Resolution 5/5 to incorporate plural approaches such as Mother Earth Centric Actions?

**Evidence**: “the purpose of the consultation on Nature-Based Solutions... is to review, complement and work on a new and additional Resolution that incorporates plural approaches to solve the climate and environmental crisis.” (p.2)
“this consultation must first be satisfactorily concluded by integrating the views of the countries in the reformulation of the UNEA Resolution 5/5, or complement it with an additional one...” (p.3)

---

### UNGEOETHICS22: Concept note of the World Commission on the Ethics of Scientific Knowledge and Technology (COMEST) on the ethics of climate engineering

**Question**: How can international law evolve beyond consensus-based contractualism to assign duties and liabilities for action and inaction in climate engineering?

**Evidence**: “International law has, till now, been highly ineffective in climate change reduction... International law is based on a contractual model (expressed in the motto: nothing is agreed until everything is agreed)... The issue becomes even more difficult when we move from impact reduction measures... to the idea of DOING something... are there in international law obligations of states to avoid the worsening of the global situation?” (V. Governance and the specific problem of international law)

---

### COMESTWATER22: Report of COMEST on water ethics: ocean, freshwater and coastal areas

**Question**: How can governance bridge fragmented regimes across fresh and marine waters, and handle asymmetries in power for fair, ecocentric outcomes?

**Evidence**: “However, it appears that long-term solutions are hampered by a fragmentation in fresh and marine water management, and need to bridge the gaps between regimes of marine environmental law and international water law.” (I.6 Plastic and Microplastic Pollution – a Global Challenge)
“Existing international law cannot adequately address water quality aspects and other important issues… Asymmetries in state power can promote unfair international water-sharing arrangements that are contrary to the concept of distributive justice.” (VI.7 Justice and International Transboundary Waters)

---

### UNSECURITY24: Envisioning security for a more-than-human world

**Question**: How do we strengthen global health governance (e.g., WHO, IHR) to ensure compliance and accountability across states and corporations?

**Evidence**: “While the IHR was designed to oversee cooperation among States, ‘there has been widespread contravention,’ and the ‘WHO lacks enforcement power,’ as Ferhani and Rushton lament... COVID-19 has further exposed the WHO’s weaknesses in terms of regulatory power.” (Global health governance section)

---

### ROMEECO22: Transforming our economies from ego to eco

**Question**: What learning infrastructures and platforms are needed to enable 4.0 governance and multi-stakeholder ecosystems?

**Evidence**: “The main barrier (and leverage point) to evolving governance structures is that two crucial elements are missing. First, in most systems we are missing platforms that bring all of the relevant stakeholders together… And second … there is no process and support infrastructure that helps them to move from debate to dialogue, and from a siloed to a shared view of the system.” (p. 10–11)

---

### IRELANDAAD22: Southern Regional Assembly 2020 Annual Report

**Question**: What implementation structures and cross-sectoral mechanisms are needed to deliver the RSES (including biodiversity and BGI/NBS aims) effectively and on time?

**Evidence**: “Within a year of the making of the RSES the SRA will establish robust implementation mechanisms, plan and structures, including cross sectoral stakeholder and cross boundary local authority steering group committees, to ensure the delivery of the RSES and the MASPs is specific measurable, attainable, realistic and time-bound. The implementation phase will include action plans that include time bound targets, progress indicators and a set project tracking plan to ensure effective and efficient delivery.” (Section 5, Regional Planning – Activities, Progress and Milestones in 2020)

---

### D4C25: Design for Environmental Conservation (Toolkit)

**Question**: How can institutions support distributed, decentralized multispecies conservation led by communities, beyond centralized, top-down models?

**Evidence**: “Traditionally, Western conservation practices have relied on centralized, top-down approaches… These methods have often excluded Indigenous and local communities… D4C emerges as a novel methodology within this field… enabling communities and stakeholders to co-create solutions relevant to their specific context.” (Ch.2; Ch.1)

---

### NPOS25: Draft State of Nature Metrics

**Question**: How can aligned institutions include Governments and IPLCs effectively in metric governance and claims to ensure legitimacy and adoption?

**Evidence**:  

> Strong support for a unified set of SON metrics... Broad feedback, but missing Government and IPLCs... Backlash has been observed... Pilots needed to validate, refine and build trust in metrics.
>
> *(Consultation findings)*



---

### NEHALF20: Narratives for the Half Earth and Sharing the Planet scenarios

**Question**: What governance reshuffling is needed to deliver HE and SP in practice at multiple scales?

**Evidence**: “Considering that both these scenarios require important governance reshuffling, some similarities can be found... From the HE perspective... a policy framework for nature conservation to be coupled with the Paris Agreement... From the SP perspective... reflections have been directed towards the local scale.” (Main findings)

---

### PBLNATUREPOS22: Exploring nature-positive pathways: contribution to CBD Post-2020 GBF

**Question**: What institutional mixes enable integrated landscape governance and cross-border supply chain transitions?

**Evidence**: “National governments can support integrated landscape approaches … via a set of policy tools, ranging from decentralisation … local partnerships … financial aid … land-use planning, secure land tenure and define environmental regulations.” (p. 20–22) “The cross-border character of many supply chains calls for an international governance approach … a combination of regulatory, financial and soft instruments have to complement each other …” (p. 24)
