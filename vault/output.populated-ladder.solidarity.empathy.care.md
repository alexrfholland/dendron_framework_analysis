### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### UNESCOEDU20: Learning to become with the world: education for future survival

- **Organisation**: Common Worlds/UNESCO
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Humanities/Ethics

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the report elevates care (caretaking relations, reparative stance, collective recuperative ethics) as a core ethic guiding more-than-human education and explores implications for practice (openness to the Other, staying with the trouble), though without concrete policy mandates. - It proposes a convivial and reparative stance as a pedagogical ethic: 

> These open relations constitute a convivial and reparative stance that ‘… welcomes surprise, entertains hope, makes connections, tolerates coexistence, and offers care for the new’ (Gibson-Graham, 2006, p. 8).
>
> *(Visionary declarations, 4)*

 - It reframes care as more-than-human: 

> Even though our new kind of education is deeply relational, it does not rely on an innocent notion of relationality... a type of transversal thinking that takes ‘issue with human exceptionalism while being accountable for the role we play.’
>
> *(Visionary declarations, 6)*

 - It concludes with a collective recuperative ethics: 

> Consistent with all of these shifts, we have adopted a completely new mode of ethics that is collective, more-than-human and recuperative.
>
> *(Visionary declarations, 7)*

 - Care is tied to political goals and outcomes (UN transformation, cosmopolitics): 

> Embracing its new name and cosmopolitical principles, it now attends to the ongoing-ness of worldly relations and grapples with the question: What kinds of worlds might we recuperate together in the midst of destruction?
>
> *(Visionary declarations, 7)*

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### EUSTI50: S&T&I for 2050: science, technology and innovation for ecosystem performance – accelerating sustainability transitions

- **Organisation**: EC DG R&I
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because care is a core conceptual device in the 'Immersing & Caring' perspective and is used to work through implications and practices (e.g., scientists as 'diplomats', local contracts/treaties, negotiation spaces) across ethics, research, and policy, though not as a discrete statutory mechanism.

- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> As a normative guiding concept, many of the scholars use the notion of 'care' as a reciprocal practice involving all types of entities including humans as one of many... Rather than applying overarching system rules, for each 'collective' a new contract must be negotiated that ensures a maximum of mutual care between diverse agents in a pluriverse of more than human beings.
>
> *(2.3 Caring within hybrid collectives)*


- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> RTI opportunities [Immersing & Caring]... Strong role for science as mediator for other voices... Include other types of knowledge (embodied, indigenous), overcome reservations towards including non‑humans on equal terms, find adequate language.
>
> *(Table 3; 2.3)*


- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Scientists, artists and indigenous people are often acting as 'diplomats' by mediating and translating as well as continuously mapping out the collectives. 'Institutional diagnostics' is used to collectively identify the governance system for each specific context that maximises ability for mutual care and prevents harm to be externalised to other collectives.

#### IPBESPATHWAYS19: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 5. Realizing a sustainable world for nature and people: transformative strategies, actions and roles for all

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the ethics of care is a core conceptual lens in Strategy 5 and across the chapter, explicitly guiding imagined futures, cultural narratives, and governance orientations (relations of care vs domination), with implications for outcomes, learning spaces, and goals; however, it does not specify a concrete institutional mechanism solely defined by care.

- Strategy 5 centers the move from domination to care: 

> Strategy 5 aims to address the root causes... transitioning from relations of domination to relations of care, thereby enhancing well-being and interdependencies in the web of life... It also involves promoting reciprocal human-nature relations...
>
> *(5.7)*


- Narratives and ethics: 

> It makes way for pluriversal imaginaries... and promotes an ethics of care and regeneration (Haraway, 2016; Puig de la Bellacasa, 2017) and amplifies more diversified values...
>
> *(5.7.2)*


- Outcomes and goals connected to care: 

> Comprehensive approaches... foster a culture of care that values nature and social justice.
>
> *(Exec. summary, point 10)*


- The framework shapes education and learning spaces: 

> Transformative learning... fostering critical reflection and the development of new capacities and behaviours... to promote a thriving, equitable and resilient future.
>
> *(Exec. summary, point 11)*

 and is tied to solution spaces and imagination infrastructures (5.7.4).

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### SCTRANSS25: Environment strategy for Scotland – transformative changes for sustainability

- **Organisation**: Scottish Government
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because ethics of care is a foundational value guiding the roadmap and is connected to guidance on practice (education, arts, community engagement, policy levers) and to outcomes (reciprocity, nonhuman flourishing), though not specified as a standalone statute.

- The report places care at the heart of transformation, extending beyond human-centred frames: 

> Relational philosophies can themselves be considered a deep leverage point... Amplifying relational thinking involves... values of care, reciprocity and solidarity...
>
> *(Executive Summary; 3.3 Relationality)*


- It proposes practical avenues to embed care (pedagogy, arts, place-based action), indicating application domains and goals: 

> Engaging communities, building awareness of relationality and ethics of care (arts for engaging communities emotionally, spiritually, bodily...); Place-based approaches for autonomous regeneration... celebration of human-nature engagement).
>
> *(Table 3: Social and cultural policy instruments)*


- It links care to multispecies justice and decision-making criteria, explicitly including nonhuman agency and labour: 

> Recognizing the emotional and spiritual dimensions... embracing of the agency... and labour of complex assemblages of non-humans... These interdependencies encourage a focus on mutualism and reciprocity, i.e. ethics of care.
>
> *(3.3 Relationality)*


- The report addresses consequences and metrics (wellbeing indicators include nonhuman wellbeing), showing the implications of adopting care ethics: 

> Promote assessment of wellbeing (human, non-human) in national indicators... foregrounding indicators such as autonomy and solidarity...
>
> *(Table 3: Prefigure & expand alternative economies)*

## Score 2: Theoretical Treatment

### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### GOVUK22: What is environmental degradation, what are its causes, and how to respond?

- **Organisation**: IDS (ESRC/FCDO)
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the paper presents care-centered human–nature relations as one of five explanatory narratives for environmental degradation and as a lens for responses; it is primarily conceptual and diagnostic rather than offering concrete empowerment mechanisms for nonhumans.

- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> The narrative therefore runs, ‘the problem is a particular style of modernity and a lack of respect for positive interactions between human and non‑human aspects of nature’. The solutions in turn lie in encouraging an ethics of care and respect for nature, rejecting patriarchal and colonial domination of nature, breaking down human–nature divisions, and relying on embedded indigenous knowledges and approaches to local land use and resource sovereignty.
>
> *(4.4 Narrative 4)*


- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> A focus on intimate connections between humans and non‑human aspects of nature suggests a focus on ‘care’, rather than control, intervention, or management... Care as an ethical and political practice in turn urges attention to the marginalised and neglected, suggesting how things could be different.
>
> *(4.4 Narrative 4)*

#### EUANTHRO: Exiting the Anthropocene? Exploring fundamental change in our relationship with nature

- **Organisation**: EEA
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the ethics of care is embedded in the proposed cultural transition (‘care-oriented and non-exploitative relationships’) and informs shifts in narratives and education, but operationalisation is outside the scope of this briefing.

- Context/synthesis: “It involves embracing a multiplicity of worldviews... fostering reciprocal, care-oriented and non-exploitative relationships with nature and people (IPBES, 2022a; Puig de la Bellacasa, 2017).” (p.7)

- Context/synthesis: The briefing ties care to learning and governance: “Governance itself has to become not only wise... but truly participatory, symbiotic and tentacular... align with the needs and concerns of those who are currently ‘left behind’, humans and non-humans...” (p.14)

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### EUHORIZON23: Horizon Europe strategic plan 2025–2027 analysis

- **Organisation**: European Commission
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because an "ethics of care

>  is explicitly referenced in a more-than-human context (caring within hybrid collectives) and used to frame one of three perspectives on flourishing ecosystems, but it remains at the level of futures framing without concrete mechanisms to embed care-based decision rights for nonhumans.

- The foresight on flourishing ecosystems articulates a care-based, more-than-human perspective: 

Caring within hybrid collectives, concerned with the establishment of caring relationships in new collectives with humans and other entities on an equal level... No other choice for humans, and ethics of care. Negotiate with other inhabitants of critical zones to allow all to flourish on their own terms; adapt to nature and its diversity." (Section 1.4 – Table: Overview of perspectives on flourishing ecosystems)

- This perspective is presented alongside implications for R&I agendas (e.g., empathy, negotiation with other inhabitants), indicating a normative ethical grounding for research and governance. (Section 1.4)

- However, the text does not translate ethics of care into institutional procedures or policy instruments; thus it remains conceptual.

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### STOCK50: Stockholm+50: unlocking a better future

- **Organisation**: SEI & CEEW
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report frames the needed ontological shift explicitly as moving from extraction to care and links this to multiple domains of policy action, but it does not directly develop a formal care-ethics governance architecture or enforceable duties of care toward nonhumans.

- Context/synthesis: It defines a societal transition from extraction to care as central to transforming human–nature relationships, situating care as a normative pole guiding policy portfolios. 

> Our relationship with nature needs redefining, from one of extraction to one of care.
>
> *(Key messages)*


- Context/synthesis: It associates this with animal welfare mainstreaming, nature-based education, and recognizing intrinsic value—concrete agenda items consistent with a care orientation—even if not codified as a care-ethics legal framework. 

> Protect animal welfare by mainstreaming it... Expand and invest in nature-based education... placing more emphasis on the intrinsic and relational value of nature.
>
> *(Summary; Recommendations)*
