## Score 4: Actionable Mechanisms

*No sources at this score level*

## Score 3: Core Conceptual Device / Implications Explored

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### STOCK50: Stockholm+50: unlocking a better future

- **Organisation**: SEI & CEEW
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the report promotes biophilic design and urban greening as core, actionable strategies (design principles, planning directives, accessibility standards) for transforming cities in line with a nature-first ethic; while not prescribing technical specs, it offers concrete decision guidance and implementation arenas (architecture, planning, valuation).

- Context/synthesis: It instructs local governments to apply biophilic design in new and retrofitted architecture, embedding nature into everyday urban life with multiple co-benefits. 

> Local governments and architects should apply biophilic design principles in new and retrofitted urban architecture and housing policy, to enable human‑nature connectedness as well as provide direct climate, biodiversity, and health benefits.
>
> *(Recommendations – Integrate nature in cities and urban areas)*


- Context/synthesis: It also directs planners to green infrastructure and improve access using standards and valuation methods, indicating tangible pathways for adoption and criteria for success. 

> Local planners should ‘green’ urban infrastructure... Access to nature in urban areas should be promoted through empowered local communities and national accessibility standards and higher economic valuation of green space.
>
> *(Recommendations – Integrate nature in cities and urban areas)*

## Score 2: Theoretical Treatment

### SCENARIOS AND FUTURES EXPLORATION

#### NEHALF20: Narratives for the Half Earth and Sharing the Planet scenarios

- **Organisation**: PBL
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because biophilic cities are explicitly incorporated as a component of the SP scenario’s urban strategy (to connect people and nature), but the report treats it as one of several design elements rather than elaborating an operational program. 

- Urban strategy statement: “Cities are biophilic, that is they are designed to support well-being and health benefits by connecting people with nature... inter-connected city parks and green and blue infrastructure.” (2.2; 5.1.3)

- Role alongside shared landscapes: “biophilic city... within the SP scenario... city’s infrastructures will create ecological networks and corridors following ecological principles to enhance biodiversity.” (6.2.5)

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### UNCITIES21: Global environment outlook for cities – towards green and just cities (GEO for Cities)

- **Organisation**: UNEP & UN-Habitat
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because biophilic cities are discussed as part of the broader renaturing/nature-based approaches and linked to examples, but are not used as the core organizing framework of the roadmap.

- Conceptual mention within renaturing: 

> Under the wide umbrella of 'urban greening', 'biophilic cities' and the 'renaturing' of cities, there is a growing call for collective action to protect biodiversity in and around cities.
>
> *(Chapter 5, 5.5.1)*


- Role in outcomes: 

> Renaturing the city to enhance health and well-being of all citizens, urban biodiversity, the provision of ecosystem services and resilience to climate change shocks.
>
> *(Figure 5.10, Pathways for nature-positive, just and equitable urban development)*


- Application through nature-based solutions: The report links biophilic approaches to specific tools like green roofs, bioswales, corridors and parks with equity safeguards. (Chapter 4, 4.2.2; Chapter 5, 5.5.1)

## Score 1: Token Acknowledgement

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### IPBESTCA2: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 2. Visions of a sustainable world – for nature and people

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because Biophilic Cities is explicitly named as one of the inspiring visions, but only cited as an example without deeper discussion or operational mechanisms in this chapter.

- The vision is named in the curated set of 44 and mapped within value framings, showing explicit inclusion: 

> Vision names: ... 44) Biophilic Cities Network; ...
>
> *(Figure 2.5 panel list)*


- Biophilic Cities is positioned among visions balancing values, but details are not developed here: 

> The 2050 Vision for Biodiversity falls squarely in the centre of all three values (Figure 2.5), similar to other visions like ‘wellbeing for all within planetary boundaries’, ‘biophilic cities’ and ‘self-realization saves humans and nature’.
>
> *(2.3.2.2)*


- Prevents higher score: no methods, policies, or participatory mechanisms for biophilic cities are provided in this chapter.

#### EUECOLOPES25: ECOlogical Building enveLOPES: A Game-Changing Design Approach for Regenerative Urban Ecosystems

- **Organisation**: Ludwig
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because the report briefly references the need to make cities more biophilic without developing the biophilic cities framework itself.

- Context/synthesis: The term is used in background framing to motivate new planning methods, but is not elaborated as a distinct framework. 

> Making cities more biophilic thus requires new planning methods that mobilize all disciplines involved in urban development (Grobman et al. 2023).
>
> *(Background and objectives)*

#### IPBESMODELS46: Report of the IPBES task force on scenarios and models – Nature Futures Scenarios

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because 'biophilic cities' are mentioned briefly in a breakout group as a related urban model aligned with NFF value perspectives, without further development.

- Single-sentence linkage in urban case group: “The ‘urban systems’ breakout group… Many similarities between the different NFF value perspectives and other existing sustainable city models were found. For example, the eco- city model was linked to the value perspective of ‘nature for society’, and the biophil ic cities model was related to the ‘nature for nature’ value perspective.” (D.b)

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### SCTRANSS25: Environment strategy for Scotland – transformative changes for sustainability

- **Organisation**: Scottish Government
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because biophilic planning is briefly listed as an option in the sectoral interventions table, without substantive engagement or an implementation pathway in the main text.

- The report includes biophilic planning under urbanisation but without elaboration: 

> Urbanisation and other large-scale infrastructure development • Biophilic planning (NSG, CG).
>
> *(Table 2: Sectoral and Cross-Sectoral Interventions)*


- The narrative emphasises broader more-than-human representation and relationality rather than specific biophilic city policies: 

> Give active voice to ‘nature’ in decision-making processes through support for political representation of ‘nature’ actors.
>
> *(Table 3: Radical and speculative future-making)*
