# SYSTEMATIC_BIAS: Systematic bias

## Sources and Questions

### UNLEGAL: Environmental rule of law: tracking progress and charting future directions

**Question**: How can civic enforcement mechanisms (like citizen complaints) avoid replicating racial bias and discriminatory impacts?

**Evidence**: “Encouraging the public to report on their neighbours potentially opens the door to discriminatory treatment or even personal vendettas… there is a risk that citizen complaints about idling could disproportionately impact racial minorities, given the ways that loitering laws have historically been used to target Black people in America… Public involvement in enforcement where there is a risk of racial bias has the potential to undermine, rather than support, environmental rule of law.” (Chapter 1, Section 1.3.3)
