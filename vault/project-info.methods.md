# Methodology

## Overview

We use the Ladder of More-than-Human Participation to structure this horizon scan, adapting the EuroScan protocol (Gutiérrez-Ibarluzea et al., 2014; Hines et al., 2019). We first define a series of innovations of the transformed system, structured by ladder rungs. We then search for and assess signals coming from practice of these innovations to assess transformation in action.

## 6-Step Process

### 1. Define weak signals as indicators of transformation

The European Commission defines horizon scanning as detecting early signals of potentially important developments through systematic observation (Cuhls, 2020). These signals emerge from diverse sources including workshops, media, surveys, grey literature, and everyday choices of residents (Hines et al., 2019; Morales & González, 2021). While many protocols prioritise high-value sources with proven reliability (Smith et al., 2010), this review deliberately seeks signals in grey literature and practice documents. This choice resists the anthropocentric bias that emerges from well-established fields and path-dependent institutional structures (Könnölä et al., 2012). We treat these documents as possible indicators of how more-than-human participation enters different domains, rather than applying the stricter evidentiary standards typical of medicine or education that might exclude these sources.

Signal quality offers one approach to understanding patterns of transformation. In futures studies, signal quality determines how information moves through systems and whether it triggers institutional responses (Rossel, 2012). Strong signals exhibit high visibility, concrete information, and immediate decision relevance, offering clear targets for strategic planning (Holopainen & Toivonen, 2012). By contrast, weak signals represent the first symptoms of change. They appear initially as background noise but reveal patterns when viewed through different frames.

Research often presumes weakness comes from marginalised positions (Mauno et al., 2023). Yet signals always remain partial and relational, requiring networks of observers to stitch together a patchwork view (Ahlqvist & Uotila, 2020; Rossel, 2012). Thus, in practice, weakness reflects bottlenecks in information and power transmission. For instance, academics may take up a signal while policy ignores it (Hiltunen, 2008). Similarly, communities can strengthen signals when they detect, amplify, and embed them into wider systems (Rossel, 2012).

Thus we align with positions that consider epistemic pluralism and warn not to prejudge the significance of signals and risk losing the weak ones (Morales & González, 2021). We treat weakness as a complex phenomenon that appears differently across policy, practice, and academic domains, shaped by bottlenecks in attention, authority, and uptake. We use the ladder to amplify weak signals by weighting our search to sources in practice and concepts from higher ladder rungs.

### 2. Define innovations emerging from research relevant to Ladder rungs

To assess signals from practice against the Ladder of More-than-Human Participation, we first search for innovations emerging in relevant fields of study and communities of practice. In the Three Horizons framework, these represent responses to changing landscapes between horizons, including approaches, technologies, evidence, actions, values, and mindsets (Sharpe et al., 2016). They function as "H2+" innovations that disrupt and enable transformative pathways towards the third horizon, or "H2-" innovations that reinforce the status quo.

We generate a list of H2+ innovations emerging in research and organise them by ladder rung. These encompass: ontological, political and policy frameworks that institutionalise more-than-human foresight; empirical evidence that reframes organisms, species and ecosystems as stakeholders; management frameworks that evaluate multispecies wellbeing; methods for more-than-human participatory approaches; and proposed future destinations.

We draw this list from handbooks and reviews across relevant sites of participation including the sciences, law, politics, human-computer interfaces, more-than-human geography, design, and management. Our research team augments this foundation with concepts and sources from their expertise in more-than-human approaches. We maintain an open list, incorporating new concepts discovered in source signals and expanding coverage through snowballing techniques.

While not exhaustive and not always mapping precisely to the Ladder, this step populates ladder rungs with empirically-grounded innovations and frameworks, allowing us to compare and assess indications of transformation emerging in practice. We provide complete descriptions of innovations and their sources in Appendix A in Supplementary Materials.

### 3. Search for signals of these innovations in practice

We detect signals using Overton.io, which provides the world's largest searchable index of policy documents, guidelines, think tank publications, and working papers. Broad search terms ('more-than-human' and 'ecocentric') capture the widest set of relevant signals. We exclude census data, university-published academic articles, secondary reports that merely cite primary sources, and documents that mention search terms only once. Targeted searches for specific concepts and destinations ('Half Earth', 'multispecies justice', 'animal-aided design') amplify detection of signals relevant to higher ladder rungs.

We reduce sources to a longlist of several hundred by examining titles, document types, author institutions, and keyword contexts. Review of abstracts and Overton-provided summaries, combined with targeted reading of sources, narrows this to approximately 100 candidates, then to 69 documents. We cease searching once themes reach saturation and no new signals emerge (Table 1).

**Table 1. Search strategy, databases, and search terms used in searches for signals.**

| Code | Database | Search term | Hits > Longlist > Shortlist |
|------|----------|-------------|------------------------------|
| O-MTH | Overton | Documents published after Jan 1st 2020 and matching the query '"more-than-human"' | 480 > 91 > 24 |
| O-ECO | Overton | Documents published after Jan 1st 2020 and matching the query 'ecocentric' | 239 > 39 > 39 |
| O-MSJ | Overton | Documents matching the query '"multispecies justice"' | 37 > 13 > 4 |
| O-EFL | Overton | Documents matching the query '"ecosystem flourishing"~5 OR "ecosystems flourishing"~5' | 938 > 5 > 4 |
| O-AFL | Overton | Documents matching the query '"nonhuman flourishing"~5 OR "nonhumans flourishing"~5' | 7 > 1> 1 |
| O-HALF | Overton | Documents matching the query '"half earth" or "nature needs half"' | 258 > 22 > 8 +1 snowball |
| O-AAD | Overton | Documents matching the query '"animal-aided design"' | 67 > 1 > 1 |
| O-BUSD | Overton | Documents matching the query '"biodiversity-sensitive urban design"' | 87 hits > 17 > 5 |
| O-MSD | Overton | Documents matching the query '"interspecies design" OR "multispecies design"' | 4 > 1 > 1 |
| O-COM | Overton | Documents matching the query '"compassionate conservation"' | 76 > 5 > 3 |

This first-pass review establishes a baseline. Future cycles can expand coverage through additional databases, terms, or disciplinary scope.

### 4. Filter and prioritise signals

We code each source across three dimensions to distinguish opportunistic reports from sustained programmes and concrete proposals, while avoiding exclusion criteria that would eliminate early indicators of transformation.

- **Intent**: We classify sources into eight categories: ontological frameworks (foundational conceptual and ethical principles); aspirational declarations (high-level goals and visions); implementation and metrics (participatory processes, indicators, methods evaluating multispecies impact); technical assessments and evidence reviews (empirical analyses); policy, legal and governance proposals (institutional mechanisms with binding or potential implications); scenarios (alternative futures); roadmaps (strategic pathways with timelines); and destinations (proposed end-states of transformed systems). Full definitions appear in [[project-info.classification]].

- **Mode of production**: We examine authorship patterns and institutional support to assess rigour and legitimacy. We differentiate between: single-author and small team reports; and larger-scale synthesis efforts involving tens to hundreds of participants through structured processes like Delphi methods or workshops. Full definitions appear in [[project-info.classification]].

- **Disciplinary belonging**: We identify authors' fields to understand whether concepts remain confined to humanities or penetrate scientific and technical domains. Full definitions appear in [[project-info.classification]].

Together, this classification establishes a common framework that captures both weak signals emerging at the margins and strong signals backed by institutional authority.

### 5. Assess and amplify signals using the Ladder

We use AI-assisted extraction to map how deeply sources engage with innovations relevant to more-than-human participation. This adapts methods increasingly used in systematic reviews (Lewis et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2023), and builds on successful applications in transformation pathway research, where AI extraction reveals patterns across diverse sources (Slingerland et al., 2024).

Unlike retrieval-augmented generation approaches that work with document fragments, we provide full source texts to GPT-5 (effort setting: medium). The model receives our list of innovations with their definitions. It then assesses how deeply each source engages with these innovations, assigning relevance scores from −1 to 4. This approach allows us to request full quotes of evidence justifying the model's scoring decisions, which we verify and adjust through manual review.

We also extract data on which entities sources recognise as potential participants (genes, organisms, taxa, holobionts, populations, collectives, ecosystems, hybrids, earth beings), their methods of participation, and any key challenges or open questions sources define as preventing advancement. For innovations scoring 3, we request evidence of how sources use these innovations to explore implications, hypotheticals, and consequences. For innovations scoring 4, we request evidence of concrete implementation including specific steps, policies, indicators, and institutionalisation mechanisms.

This systematic approach produces a cross-mapping from our large dataset, identifying hot spots as well as anomalies that merit focused synthesis. The full extraction protocol appears in [[project-info.prompt]]. Individual extractions appear in the analysis results.

### 6. Synthesise transformation in action

The final step traces how participation moves from discourse into implementation across ladder rungs, identifying patterns of transformation and gaps requiring future attention.
