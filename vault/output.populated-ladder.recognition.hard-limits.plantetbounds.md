## Score 4: Actionable Mechanisms

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### UNPLANETBOUND22: Thematic study: planetary boundaries

- **Organisation**: UNDRR
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because the study centrally adopts the Planetary Boundaries framework to guide more-than-human, risk-informed governance and provides detailed, actionable mechanisms for implementation across Sendai’s priorities (e.g., mainstream PB metrics, translate to national targets, develop allocation principles, use Earth System models, reform finance and governance). - The report frames PB as the core scientific lens and links it to Sendai DRR with explicit operational tasks: 

> The planetary boundaries framework provides an important basis for understanding just how perilous the new risk landscape actually is... The implementation challenge for the Sendai Framework is how to improve effectiveness in keeping humanity from crossing planetary boundaries... [and] how best to promote and support the integration of risk reduction throughout the key global regimes.
>
> *(Part 1.5 / Part 4.1)*

 - It specifies concrete DRR actions and tools: 

> Implement Planetary Boundaries as metrics to monitor environmental health and sustainability progress to aid decision making... Governments are supported in translating the planetary boundary processes to the scales needed for implementation... Support governments in mapping, monitoring and projecting the biophysical dimension of planetary boundaries... Earth System models... can help to understand coupled Earth system processes.
>
> *(Part 2.3.2, Priority for Action 1, Messages 1.2 and 1.4)*

 - It outlines policy mechanisms and institutional reforms: 

> Environmental governance systems... should be designed as fully functioning complex adaptive systems that effectively manage other complexly adaptive natural and social systems... Existing environmental treaty regimes should be strengthened by bolstering the legal boundaries that correspond with the planetary boundaries... develop robust allocation principles to ensure the fair share of the safe operating space.
>
> *(Part 2.3.2, Priority for Action 2, Messages 2.2)*

 - It details finance and procurement levers aligned to PB: 

> Governments... address the serious misallocation of capital... Consider mandatory reporting requirements for financial institutions on climate and nature-risk exposures... a 'Think Resilience' approach that should become mandatory in all public procurement processes, as well as private sector investment.
>
> *(Part 2.3.2, Priority for Action 3, Messages 3.1)*

#### LANCETFOOD19: Food in the Anthropocene: the EAT–Lancet Commission on healthy diets from sustainable food systems

- **Organisation**: Lancet
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because planetary boundaries are the core conceptual and quantitative mechanism of the Commission, integrated with health targets to define a 'safe operating space' for food systems, and are operationalized into specific, actionable food-system boundaries (GHGs, land, water, nitrogen, phosphorus, biodiversity) with implementation strategies.

- Foundational mechanism and integration with outcomes: “The Commission integrates, with quantification of universal healthy diets, global scientific targets for sustainable food systems, and aims to provide scientific boundaries to reduce environmental degradation caused by food production at all scales… The Commission concludes that quantitative scientific targets constitute universal and scalable planetary boundaries for the food system.” (Executive summary)

- Concrete, quantified boundaries and indicators: “These boundaries include the total global amount of cropland use, biodiversity loss, water use, greenhouse-gas emissions, and nitrogen and phosphorus pollution that can be due to food production (table 2)… These boundaries for human health and food production identify the safe operating space within which food systems should jointly operate…” (Safe operating space for food systems)

- Explicit numeric targets for implementation: “We propose a boundary for greenhouse-gas emissions from food production… kept at or less than 5 Gt of carbon dioxide equivalent per year in 2050… global land use from food production should be kept at or below 13 M km² (11–15 M km²)… a global water boundary for food production of about 2500 km³/year… global application boundary of nitrogen… 90 Tg of nitrogen per year… global long-term boundary of phosphorus application from food production to be 8 Tg of phosphorus per year…” (Climate change; Land-system change; Freshwater use; Nitrogen and phosphorus flows)

- Implications/hypotheticals/solutions and criteria: “To stay within the safe operating space for food systems, a combination of dietary changes and production and management-related measures are required… adopting the reference diet… closing yield gaps… rebalancing fertiliser… halving food loss and waste… implementing all available bottom-up options for mitigating food-related greenhouse-gas emissions.” (Section 3)

- Cross-domain ethical/science/technical/political strategy: “We outline five specific and implementable strategies… Seek international and national commitment to shift towards healthy diets; Re-orient agricultural priorities; Sustainably intensify food production; Strong and coordinated governance of land and oceans; At least halve food losses and waste…” (Executive summary; Section 4)

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### EURIGHTS: Towards an EU Charter of the Fundamental Rights of Nature

- **Organisation**: EESC
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because planetary boundaries are used as a founding constraint for governance and the Charter operationalizes them into non-regression, resilience assessments, and legal criteria guiding EU policy, with concrete legislative proposals.

- PBs as framing constraint for law and policy: 

> The overcom ing of three of the nine 'Planetary Boundaries' (namely: climate change; reduction of biodiversity; disruption of the nitrogen cycle), scientifically identified as the security conditions for the stability of the entire biosphere.
>
> *(Box 3, p. 56-57)*


- PBs linked to concrete legal rules and decision criteria: 

> Non‑regression... always aims to ensure the 'highest level of environmental protection' for the survival of the whole earth system... Non-regression... can be considered as 'Nature and Climate First' rather than 'Development First'.
>
> *(Section 5.6.1, p. 73-74)*


- PBs integrated with SDGs and governance indicators: 

> If we map the UN SDGs and Planetary Boundaries onto these 3 concentric circles, we end up with a practical workable model for implementation of the Rights of Nature.
>
> *(Executive Summary, p. 5)*


- Implementation mechanisms and tools (resilience study/AoR) tie PBs to practice: 

> It is possible to combine Rights of Nature with the rule of resilience within the legislation on environmental impacts... the regulation of a 'resilience study' (RS) and an 'assessment of resilience' (AoR) could become an important link between Rights of Nature... and environmental assessments.
>
> *(Section 5.6.2, p. 75-77)*


- EU legislative pathway and institutional reforms to embed PBs: 

> The Charter must promote the objectives of the SDGs and planetary boundaries in law... Operationalizing the planetary boundaries... at Member State levels... would form the basis of the implementation of the Rights of Nature framework.
>
> *(Section 5.5, p. 70; Section 5.3, p. 66)*

## Score 3: Core Conceptual Device / Implications Explored

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### EIVIS23: Exploring new visions for a sustainable bioeconomy

- **Organisation**: JRC, EC
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because planetary boundaries are used as a core guiding framework to redefine sustainability and the bioeconomy’s goals, with explicit implications for policy indicators and governance, but without fully operationalized enforcement mechanisms. - Context/synthesis: The report reframes sustainability around biophysical hard limits and embeds these into its definition of a sustainable bioeconomy, linking to Rockström et al. and using boundaries to structure the Bioeconomy Monitoring System compass and trajectories. 

> In broad terms, in this report we frame bioeconomy governance as a process to deliberate on how to govern highly intertwined social-ecological systems towards the goal of a ‘sustainable bioeconomy’, where sustainability is defined as maintaining the integrity of the biosphere and promoting social equity and justice, regardless of the economic system and processes in place.
>
> *(p. 10)*


- Context/synthesis: Boundaries are used to critique green growth narratives and set the direction for transformations, including revising indicators. 

> Especially in ecological terms, they have shown to be not consistent with the biophysical limits of the planet.
>
> *(Executive summary, p. 3-4)*


- Context/synthesis: The compass metaphor explicitly requires calibration against overlooked knowledge that may further restrict desirable pathways—this operationalizes boundaries conceptually into monitoring design. 

> We argue that this compass can only be effective if: 1) the ‘North’ is well-defined, and 2) if the compass is well calibrated... if this ‘uncomfortable knowledge’, once included, were to restrict our desirable pathway... then we would be suffering from hypocognition.
>
> *(p. 13-14)*


- Context/synthesis: The report proposes adding justice indicators and revising the BMS objectives to reflect biosphere integrity as non-negotiable limits, showing implications for measures of progress. 

> The following three points establish a hierarchy of priorities: 1. The integrity of the biosphere and our life-support systems provides non-negotiable limits. 2. Economic and social inequity... 3. Economic systems are means to an end.
>
> *(p. 9-10)*

#### EUTRANS24: Mapping ERC frontier research: addressing climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution

- **Organisation**: ERC
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the report uses planetary boundaries centrally across research domains (food systems, freshwater, safe operating space) and documents projects that create new boundary metrics (e.g., freshwater boundary), models, and SDG-aligned policies—developing implications, indicators, and criteria for success.

- Context/synthesis: It frames transformative change in relation to the ‘safe operating space’ and documents boundary-based modeling of decoupling and provisioning systems. 

> SOS.aquaterra... established a new planetary boundary for freshwater change... developed an integrated food system model... estimate... combined potential... to meet future food demand within a safe operating space.
>
> *(5.3; 4.1)*


- Context/synthesis: It tightly couples boundary concepts with SDG/Green Deal priorities (water, land, nutrients, biosphere integrity), evidencing multi-domain indicator development and policy implications. 

> The project... identify measures that are socio-economically feasible to meet future food demand while respecting key planetary boundaries in food production: water, land, nutrients and biosphere integrity...
>
> *(5.3)*

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### IMFNAT: Embedded in nature: nature-related economic and financial risks and policy considerations

- **Organisation**: IMF
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the IMF note employs planetary boundaries and Earth-system tipping points as foundational mechanisms to frame macroeconomic and financial stability risks (‘macro-criticality’) and develops policy implications (e.g., aligning macro-financial frameworks with boundaries, ‘do no harm’ climate–nature policy integration), including supervisory expectations, scenarios, and indicators.

- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Out of the nine planetary boundaries identified by the scientific community as those within which humanity can safely operate, six planetary boundaries—related to biosphere integrity, climate change, land system change, biochemical flows (nitrogen and phosphorus), freshwater, and novel entities—have been crossed.
>
> *(Introduction)*


- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Policy frameworks in advanced, emerging, and developing economies need to evolve to embrace environmental sustainability. Recognizing the importance of planetary boundaries, economic policy frameworks need to acknowledge that economic activities can have far‑reaching environmental impacts... and potentially trigger cascading effects...
>
> *(Takeaways for the Global Community)*


- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> We propose a conceptual framework... connecting nature to the macroeconomy and the financial system... governance by the laws of physics and chemistry... tipping points and cascading nature‑climate impacts... call for a ‘do no harm’ principle to ensure that climate objectives do not harm nature objectives, and vice versa.
>
> *(Background and Conceptual Framework; Policy Considerations)*


- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Two potential implications stand out. First, the existence of ecological tipping points suggests the need to build social and political consensus on transitioning away from non‑sustainable economic activities. Second, there is a need to reorient policies to prioritize the rapid transformation of the productive structure of the economy to align with planetary boundaries.
>
> *(Policy Considerations)*


- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Scenario analysis should cover key macroeconomic transmission channels, including the impacts of nature loss and policies addressing it to systemically important prices and financial stability.

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### EUCLIM24: Towards sustainable transformation: research priorities in climate change and biodiversity

- **Organisation**: EC
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because planetary boundaries are used as a core framing to diagnose the state of the Earth system and to orient research priorities (safe and just corridor, Earth Commission), with implications for governance and funding, though without detailed implementation mechanisms. - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> The most recent assessment of Planetary Boundaries finds that six of the nine boundaries are crossed (Richardson et al. 2023). Groups like the Future Earth-hosted Earth Commission continue work to define a safe and just corridor for people and the planet (Rockström et al., 2023; Rockström et al. 2024).

#### TWITRANS18: Transformations to achieve the sustainable development goals

- **Organisation**: IIASA (TWI2050)
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the Planetary Boundaries framework is used as a core guiding frame across the report to bound development within a “safe operating space,” and the text explicitly works through implications, pathways, and governance instruments consistent with those bounds, but it does not lay out a single, concrete, institutional mechanism to operationalize planetary boundaries in law or policy (hence not a 4).

- The report frames its entire agenda as achieving sustainable development within a safe operating space defined by planetary boundaries, using this as the normative boundary for backcasting and scenario design: 

> The United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda… integrates… goals for inclusive social and economic development, to occur within global environmental targets for oceans, freshwater, biodiversity, and climate, i.e., essentially a roadmap for redefining sustainable development as a people and planet agenda for achieving a prosperous and fair world within planetary boundaries.
>
> *(Introduction)*


- It explicitly links current trends to transgression of boundaries and argues for transformation to remain within these limits: 

> We have transgressed several planetary boundaries that regulate the stability of the Earth system (Steffen et al., 2015; Rockström et al., 2009), and thereby the ability of Earth to provide essential support functions, fundamental conditions for good and healthy lives, and ultimately a stable state of the planet.
>
> *(World at crossroads)*


- The conceptual framework operationalizes boundaries as bounds to planning (backcasting) and integrates them with SDG targets for 2030/2050 to shape pathways and indicators: 

> Two sets of science-based, normative targets provide bounds for the transformation toward sustainable future. The first are symbolized by the SDGs for 2030 and the second for 2050 and beyond symbolizes the achievement just and equitable future for all on a resilient planet. The gray band illustrates the overarching narrative… by ‘backcasting’ from the normative targets.
>
> *(Figure 1 caption, 1.3 TWI2050 framework)*


- The text derives implications and strategies—across energy, land, water, cities—required to stay within boundaries, showing how boundaries guide solutions (hypotheticals and criteria for success): 

> It is therefore necessary to reduce energy-related greenhouse gas emissions dramatically and decarbonize the world’s energy system by midcentury… The various decarbonization scenarios… comprise four pillars: i) energy efficiency… ii) zero-carbon power… iii) electrification and fuel switching… iv) universal access…
>
> *(Decarbonization and energy)*

 

> The protection of biodiversity… implies a reduction of total agricultural land… This means sustainable scenarios are based on a combination of diet change and yield increase.
>
> *(Food, biosphere and water)*


- Governance and policy analysis explicitly ties to this bounded framing, addressing instruments and institutional needs to navigate boundary constraints: 

> The general strategy of sustainable development is to build alliances for change, overcome vested interests, invest in new governance capacities and adopt a range of economic policy instruments to steer the economy and society along the six major transformations towards sustainable development… corrective pricing… direct regulation… development financing…
>
> *(Policy instruments and societal innovations)*


- The report also sets goals and indicators linked to planetary boundaries to monitor success: 

> TWI2050 identifies two multidimensional, science-based targets… The main objective is to specify targets as quantitative information to complement the TWI2050 overarching narrative.
>
> *(1.3.2 Targets and indicators)*


- It synthesizes consequences of exceeding boundaries and uses that as a rationale for mitigation/adaptation roadmaps: 

> Climatic changes have affected some infectious disease vectors… Given that warming of nearly 1.5°C… is projected to occur by about 2030–2040, increases in the burden of climate-sensitive health outcomes are very likely…
>
> *(Health section)*

## Score 2: Theoretical Treatment

### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### UNSECURITY24: Envisioning security for a more-than-human world

- **Organisation**: UNDP
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because Planetary Boundaries are discussed with some depth and used to set the problem context (Anthropocene pressures, tipping points), but the paper does not propose detailed PB-aligned institutional mechanisms beyond referencing their importance. - It introduces PB and their policy value: “They proposed nine quantitative ‘planetary boundaries’ or ‘fences’ within which human enterprise can operate safely... broader transformation demands a shift in mindset to act cooperatively, simultaneously and at multiple scales... A planetary-level reboot is required.” (The Anthropocene’s more-than-human world) - It links PB to metrics and HDI: “The report incorporates a conjoined human-environmental vision in setting out how to make ‘planetary pressure adjustments’ to its annual human development index (HDI)... ‘reimagining the human development journey as one in which the expanding human freedoms also ease planetary pressures’.” (Building consensus / metrics)

#### ROMEECO22: Transforming our economies from ego to eco

- **Organisation**: Club of Rome
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because planetary boundaries are directly referenced as a foundation for the initiative, but the document does not move beyond conceptual framing to define actionable mechanisms that include nonhuman empowerment.

- The report explicitly builds on planetary boundaries: 

> Earth4All was initiated by The Club of Rome … It builds on the legacies of The Limits to Growth and the planetary boundaries frameworks.
>
> *(References page/endnote, p. 16)*


- The author’s five interventions are framed as high-level shifts consistent with staying within boundaries, but no specific cross-species decision-making structures are proposed: 

> the greatest potential for change lies in our capacity to 'transcend paradigms' … five key interventions are needed …
>
> *(p. 2)*


- Reference to Meadows’ leverage points situates boundaries within systems thinking, still without concrete more-than-human governance: 

> Meadows … identified 12 different leverage points … The goals of the system … the mindset or paradigm … the power to transcend paradigms.
>
> *(p. 2–3)*

#### EUANTHRO: Exiting the Anthropocene? Exploring fundamental change in our relationship with nature

- **Organisation**: EEA
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the briefing uses the planetary boundaries framework explicitly to frame the problem (‘safe boundaries’) and urgency, but does not design a planetary boundaries governance mechanism in this document.

- Context/synthesis: It explicitly cites the safe operating space and boundary exceedance to frame the Anthropocene problem: “we are getting worryingly close to or even exceeding what some consider ‘safe boundaries’ (Rockström et al., 2009; Steffen et al., 2015a...)” (p.1–2)

- Context/synthesis: It references Europe’s state relative to limits and boundary work: “Is Europe living within the limits of our planet?” (EEA/FOEN, 2020) (p.2)

- Context/synthesis: It uses boundary framing to motivate systemic change: “Only a system-wide transformation will achieve well-being for all within the Earth’s capacity to support life...” (p.8)

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### UNLAND17_2: The Global Land Outlook: Part 2 - The Outlook

- **Organisation**: UNCCD
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report explicitly references the Planetary Boundaries concept (by name) to frame unsustainable trends (e.g., nitrogen), but it is used descriptively to set context rather than as an operational framework with mechanisms or indicators for governance or policy implementation.

- The report uses Planetary Boundaries to frame agriculture’s transgression (the nitrogen boundary) and situate the problem, without detailing boundary-based governance tools: 

> While it is hard to generalize, it seems that overall farming has become more productive but less sustainable in the last few decades, and is now exceeding planetary boundaries for stressors such as nitrogen levels in the ecosystem.
>
> *(Chapter 7, Introduction)*


- The text links boundary transgression with concrete environmental harms and calls for change, but does not present boundary-based triggers or decision rules: 

> While fertilizers have been responsible for increasing crop yields, the inefficiency in their application leads to major detriment in the wider environment... Reactive nitrogen added to the biosphere through human activity now exceeds that made available through natural processes.
>
> *(Chapter 7, Pollution from agrochemicals)*


- It frames the nitrogen boundary transgression in an integrated problem statement (ecosystem/health) rather than in a boundary compliance program: 

> Excess nutrients promote rapid algal growth... Dead zones... have doubled in each of the last four decades, with over 500 currently known... Nitrous oxide is an increasingly important greenhouse gas, with emissions largely arising from agriculture.
>
> *(Chapter 7, Pollution from agrochemicals)*

#### IPBESTCA2: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 2. Visions of a sustainable world – for nature and people

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because planetary boundaries are explicitly discussed and integrated into alternative economic visions (and placement of inspiring visions), but remain at a conceptual level here without detailing concrete mechanisms for governance in a more-than-human sense.

- Planetary boundaries frame highlighted visions with explicit references to staying within biogeophysical limits: 

> Wellbeing for all within planetary boundaries... synthesizes multiple approaches that broadly integrate social and economic thresholds so that humanity can live within planetary boundaries in better harmony with nature, ensuring a ‘safe operating space’ for humans while staying within biogeophysical planetary limits.
>
> *(Table 2.1)*


- The mapping of inspiring visions references the feasibility and desirability of balancing values within limits: 

> These placements show that it is possible to reconcile these three values of nature and their associated visions in potentially transformative ways.
>
> *(2.3.2.2)*


- The chapter links planetary boundaries to political feasibility via reduced resistance: 

> An example is the vision ‘wellbeing for all within planetary boundaries’. This vision motivates ongoing efforts of some cities, regions and even countries... towards developing more equitable economies that operate within planetary boundaries.
>
> *(2.3.2.1)*


- Prevents higher score: no detailed policy instruments, institutions, or enforcement mechanisms are specified here.

#### EUSTI50: S&T&I for 2050: science, technology and innovation for ecosystem performance – accelerating sustainability transitions

- **Organisation**: EC DG R&I
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because planetary boundaries are explicitly referenced as a guiding concept within the co‑shaping perspective and used to locate critical arenas (e.g., doughnut economy within planetary boundaries), but they are not translated into specific nonhuman empowerment mechanisms.

- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> In a similar way, notions like the ‘Doughnut Economy’ within the planetary boundaries concept allow identification of critical social/ecological arenas. What is common to all these approaches is the need to investigate the specific conditions for each individual socio‑ecological system...
>
> *(2.2 Co‑shaping socio‑ecological systems)*


- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Convergence now cannot only be understood as 'unification of science...' but also convergence of S&T&I and societal focus on transformation challenges as expressed by the 'Clean‑Planet‑for‑all' vision for 2050 and the Sustainability Development Goals.

#### TNBEYOND24: Analysing the beyond growth debate

- **Organisation**: TNO Publiek
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because planetary boundaries are explicated as an empirical scaffold (including decoupling debates) for multiple frameworks (Doughnut, degrowth), but the document functions as a review rather than proposing a specific boundary-governance package.

- The review connects boundaries and decoupling evidence to alternative economic proposals: 

> Haberl et al. (2020)... no evidence exists of long-term and all-encompassing decoupling of economic growth from degradation of environmental capital.
>
> *(A.2.4)*


- It shows how boundaries structure Doughnut’s ecological ceiling and policy implications: 

> According to Raworth (2017), we... are overshooting ecological boundaries... the economy is seen [as] an open subsystem of the closed Earth system...
>
> *(A.4.2)*


- It proposes research questions on translating indicators into policy, indicating implications for practice: 

> How could the policy impact chain of degrowth... be completed? What could be a possible scaling mechanism... What are potential side-effects and drawbacks...
>
> *(A.5.5)*

#### UNTRANS25: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 1. Transformative change and a sustainable world

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because planetary boundaries are explicitly referenced to set hard biophysical limits and tipping points, but the chapter does not operationalize boundary-based governance mechanisms for nonhuman empowerment. - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Action is not only necessary, but also increasingly urgent as several biophysical tipping points are now being rapidly approached and the current rate of biodiversity loss within both terrestrial and marine ecosystems is projected to result in the rapid decline and possible collapse of key ecosystem functions.
>
> *(Section 1.2.1)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Importantly, surpassing thresholds in either climate change or biodiversity loss can trigger biophysical tipping points, prompting uncontrolled and sudden shifts that feedback onto one another... Several irreversible tipping points are rapidly approaching.
>
> *(Section 1.2.1)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> The IPBES Global Assessment (2019a) concluded that 'urgent and concerted efforts fostering transformative change' are necessary... The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (2023) also highlights a 'rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all'.

#### IPBESTCA4: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 4. Overcoming the challenges of achieving transformative change

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the chapter explicitly references the planetary boundaries framework (including novel entities) to frame the problem and provide empirical context, but does not operationalize it as a core guiding mechanism nor provide concrete implementation steps tied to planetary boundaries. - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Growing evidence of anthropogenic environmental degradation has led to the establishment of internationally agreed-upon frameworks such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and, more recently, the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework... Despite these efforts, extraction and pressure on biodiversity continue to escalate sharply (Dirzo et al., 2014; Steffen et al., 2007; Venter et al., 2016) endangering the stability of the biosphere (IPBES, 2019a; Rockström et al., 2009; Steffen et al., 2018).
>
> *(4.1 Introduction)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Commodity life cycles also include the production and release of hazardous entities such as plastics, in many cases as microplastic, into the biosphere at levels that exceed safe planetary boundaries for novel entities (Persson et al., 2022). Approximately 7 billion of the 9.2 billion tons of plastic produced between 1950 and 2017 ended up in landfills or were dumped, affecting people and wildlife

#### IPBESPATHWAYS19: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 5. Realizing a sustainable world for nature and people: transformative strategies, actions and roles for all

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because planetary boundaries are explicitly referenced as part of competing economic paradigms and measures (framing and comparison), but not operationalized with detailed mechanisms in this chapter.

- The chapter situates “Wellbeing within Planetary Boundaries” among three main approaches to transforming economic systems: 

> Wellbeing within Planetary Boundaries (including proposals for an economy of the common good, doughnut economy and buen vivir) (Annex 5.4).
>
> *(5.5)*


- The discussion frames boundaries as guiding macro visions rather than detailing boundary-based governance instruments in this chapter: the section constitutes a comparative review of paradigms rather than implementation guidance (5.5; Annex 5.4 referenced).

---

#### EUHORIZON23: Horizon Europe strategic plan 2025–2027 analysis

- **Organisation**: European Commission
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the document explicitly invokes the planetary boundaries framework as a guiding constraint and ambition for R&I (

> within planetary boundaries

; 

> respecting planetary boundaries

), but treats it conceptually without detailing concrete governance or enforcement mechanisms that would operationalise planetary boundaries in decision-making for nonhumans.

- The analysis frames productivity and policy aims in terms of operating within planetary limits, signalling the use of planetary boundaries to structure goals: 

> (Sustainable) productivity growth entails more (equal) output with the same (or fewer) resources. Such an improvement in the efficiency of production systems is necessary to reduce the impact of production on planetary boundaries. At the same time, productivity is not a solution to all our problems, as political consensus is necessary to direct the fruits of productivity... while respecting planetary boundaries.
>
> *(Section 1.3)*


- The framework is used to specify end-states and criteria for food systems, indicating a boundary-based success condition: 

> This is covered by expected impact 30 'food and nutrition security for all within planetary boundaries is ensured through knowledge, innovation and digitalisation in agriculture, fisheries, aquaculture and food systems, which are sustainable, resilient, inclusive, safe and healthy from farm to fork'.
>
> *(Gap analysis, Cluster 6 – Food systems)*


- The cross-cutting orientation ties EU R&I transformation aims to boundary-respecting pathways: 

> Focusing overall on the key themes of resilience and the just green and digital transition, this analysis provides orientations on society’s demands for R&I... with sustainable development as an essential guideline.

 [earlier paraphrase] and throughout refers to action 

> within planetary boundaries

 as a core criterion across sectors (e.g., agriculture, bioeconomy, circularity). (Multiple sections)

- What prevents a higher score is that, although planetary boundaries are repeatedly used as a conceptual limit and target, the text does not lay out concrete, enforceable mechanisms (e.g., boundary-based budgeting, caps, or institutional designs) that would translate boundaries into binding governance across sectors or explicitly empower nonhumans.

This scores 2 because planetary boundaries are explicitly used to frame Anthropocene insecurity and the limits of environmental policy, anchoring security analysis in earth-system thresholds; the work is conceptual and diagnostic rather than a boundary-governance implementation guide.

- Context/synthesis: The volume foregrounds planetary boundaries as the scale-setting for Anthropocene risk and as a rationale for rethinking security beyond pollution control. 

> Addressing the interconnections among the different components of the environmental crisis, the Stockholm Resilience Centre has promoted the idea of ‘planetary boundaries’... Within these boundaries there is a ‘safe operating space’; outside them there are dangers we currently glimpse but do not know...
>
> *(Chapter 5 – A parallel operating sphere: Economics)*


- Context/synthesis: It ties boundary overshoot to rising insecurities and argues that security policy should be formulated relative to the SDGs and a safe operating space rather than traditional territorial defense alone. 

> If human progress is a journey, the SDGs help navigate a safe route... safety from security challenges forms the peace ceiling... In short the objective of a security policy... is to support the continuation of human progress as spelled out in the 17 SDGs.
>
> *(Chapter 5 – Objectives, actors and instruments)*

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### IPANP24: The Undemocratic Origins Of The Nature Positive Plan

- **Organisation**: IPA
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because planetary boundaries are explicitly discussed with multiple paragraphs to situate the origins of biodiversity targets, but only as critical context; the source neither adopts nor operationalizes the framework for more-than-human empowerment.

- The report links the Aichi targets and later ambitions to Planetary Boundaries, while critiquing their origin: 

> The epistemic impetus for the Aichi Targets was provided by two journal articles by a group of environmental scientists arguing for the establishment of and adherence to ‘planetary boundaries’ to establish what they termed ‘a safe operating space for humanity’... The idea had been developed at a forum in June 2008 hosted by the Stockholm Resilience Centre...
>
> *(p. 7–8)*


- It elaborates the development path and actors (Ehrlich, Lynas) behind Planetary Boundaries as agenda-driven: 

> The authors acknowledged the assistance of Lynas thus: ‘Mark Lynas has provided valuable inputs for the advancement of this paper through his initiative to write a book popularizing the science behind our planetary boundaries analysis’.
>
> *(p. 7–8)*


- The narrative uses Planetary Boundaries to critique vagueness and soft law, not to empower nonhuman governance: 

> The result is often resort to vague concepts that have public relations appeal... ‘Nature Positive’ and ’30x30’ fit this pattern to a tee.
>
> *(p. 3)*

### SCENARIOS AND FUTURES EXPLORATION

#### NESTORIES24: Mapping and analysis of alternative growth paradigms: towards a taxonomy and storylines

- **Organisation**: MultiFutures/TNO
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report uses planetary boundaries to structure the storylines and scenario objectives (e.g., meeting Rockström’s planetary targets), but it is a mapping/scoping deliverable not a policy design.

- Context/synthesis: It motivates the need for alternative paradigms due to boundary transgression: “scientists warn that out of a set of nine scientifically recognized planetary boundaries six are already surpassed (Richardson et al., 2023).” (p.8)

- Context/synthesis: Planetary boundaries are explicitly used as potential targets in contrasting storylines: “Most probable sustainability goals... are the current climate change goals... However, also more ambitious sustainability goals aiming to meet the Rockström planetary targets... could be imagined...” (p.45)

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### UNLAND17_3: The Global Land Outlook: Part 3 - A More Secure Future

- **Organisation**: UNCCD
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report explicitly invokes the planetary boundaries concept to frame the problem and the need for biophysical limits, engaging it in multiple sentences as contextual justification, but it does not operationalize the planetary boundaries framework with specific governance mechanisms or metrics beyond general guidance.

- The report frames its approach by acknowledging planetary limits and positions landscape approaches within that context: 

> Recognizing that the world is at a critical juncture pushing against planetary boundaries, we argue that a broader, landscape approach to management, which considers and integrates a wide range of land use strategies, can help reverse many of the current negative trends in land degradation.
>
> *(Part Three – Opening overview)*


- It also explicitly calls for an "age of respect

>  governed by biophysical limits: 

We can catalyze the shift needed to move from the current ‘age of plunder’ toward an ‘age of respect’ – one that accepts a world governed by biophysical limits and seeks to maintain life within those boundaries. Nature offers us many opportunities by which we can transform the way we consume, produce, work, and live together without compromising socio-economic and environmental security for current and future generations.

>  (Part Three – Introduction)

- The emphasis on staying within hard limits is repeated as a guiding principle for planning: 

Here we set out some of the guiding principles upon which individuals, communities, corporations, and countries can make informed decisions that will define the future quality of life on the planet, and describe how these principles underpin an integrated landscape approach to sustainable development." (Part Three – Introduction)

- However, beyond framing, the report does not translate the planetary boundaries framework itself into concrete, boundary-linked targets or institutional arrangements; instead it shifts to Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) as its operational framework. This prevents a higher score.

#### ISCHEALTH21: Urban health and wellbeing in the Anthropocene: interdisciplinary science-action plan 2021–2025

- **Organisation**: ISC/ISUH/IAP
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because planetary boundaries are explicitly discussed with detail to frame limits and the need to operate within them, but the document does not provide specific governance or institutional mechanisms tied to planetary boundaries for empowering nonhumans. - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: The plan positions planetary boundaries as hard limits that urban systems must respect, anchoring its shift from solely human health to planetary health, yet it does not translate the framework into detailed institutional steps: 

> Living in a big world on a small planet means that humanity has produced such large pressures on Planet Earth that people have become the largest force of change at the planetary scale. From the nine planetary boundaries, four have been crossed: loss of biosphere integrity; climate change; land-system change; and altered biogeochemical cycles. Moreover, the rate of change of the Earth’s system is accelerating.
>
> *(Section 2.1)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: The plan repeatedly ties its goals to staying within planetary boundaries, which acknowledges nonhuman system integrity as a constraint, but remains at the level of direction-setting rather than detailed implementation: 

> This New Science Plan (2021-2025) ... makes a shift from ‘improving health and wellbeing of people in cities’ to ‘improving population and planetary health in the context of complex urban systems’. The fundamental difference lies in the recognition that in an age of the Anthropocene a less anthropocentric and more eco-centric view is essential. It recognizes humans as part of global ecosystems... The programme’s activities... seek to improve urban health and wellbeing within planetary boundaries and while harnessing synergies across health and sustainability.
>
> *(Summary; Preface One)*

#### UNCITIES21: Global environment outlook for cities – towards green and just cities (GEO for Cities)

- **Organisation**: UNEP & UN-Habitat
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because planetary boundaries are used to frame the urgency and limits for cities, connecting decoupling and safe operating space to the urban vision, but are not elaborated as a specific instrument with city-level procedures.

- Framing and implications: 

> Cities must grapple with... decoupling energy and material consumption from the economy and aligning them with planetary boundaries...
>
> *(Chapter 4, 4.1)*


- Link to goals: The report references safe operating spaces and systemic limits as constraints for urban strategies across all three dimensions. (Chapter 4, 4.2)

- Ethical integration: The dimension ties boundaries to justice (“for whom are we planning an inclusive and just city”) and multispecies rights. (Chapter 4, 4.2.3)

#### UNESCOEDU21: Reimagining our futures together: a new social contract for education

- **Organisation**: UNESCO
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report explicitly references planetary boundaries and that humanity is exceeding them, framing risks and the need for rebalancing with the living planet, but does not operationalize the planetary boundaries framework in more-than-human governance. - It acknowledges exceeding planetary boundaries: 

> Widening social and economic inequality, climate change, biodiversity loss, resource use that exceeds planetary boundaries, democratic backsliding and disruptive technological automation are the hallmarks of our current historical juncture.
>
> *(Executive summary)*

 - It elaborates how human activity surpasses regenerative capacity and what that implies: 

> Today we far surpass planetary boundaries in terms of material production, consumption and waste... Without course correction, in 2050 we will be using resources at four times the rate it takes for them to replenish and will hand future generations a gravely depleted planet.
>
> *(Part I, Chapter 2: A planet in peril)*

#### SCTRANSS25: Environment strategy for Scotland – transformative changes for sustainability

- **Organisation**: Scottish Government
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because planetary boundaries are substantively discussed as empirical constraints and justice considerations, but are not themselves detailed as a specific governance mechanism for Scotland in this report.

- The report synthesises boundary status and justice framing, setting the problem context for transformative policies: 

> Six of the nine planetary boundaries have been crossed... Earth system justice means living in a just manner within boundaries... should be adjusted to reduce harm and increase access...
>
> *(2. Global policy and science-policy discourse)*


- It uses boundary transgression and tipping cascades to justify urgency and the need for deep leverage points: 

> The Global Tipping Points report... identifies 26 tipping points... Five of these are already at risk... The domino effect is anticipated to be one of accelerating and unmanageable change...
>
> *(2. Global policy and science-policy discourse)*


- Boundaries inform values and paradigm-shift propositions, but operational mechanisms are provided through other frameworks (post-growth, rights of nature, commoning): 

> Transformative change... deeper shifts in goals, values and paradigms... specific policy levers which can contribute... economic and financial measures... legal pathways...
>
> *(Executive Summary; Table 3)*

#### STOCK50: Stockholm+50: unlocking a better future

- **Organisation**: SEI & CEEW
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because planetary boundaries are explicitly cited to frame the problem and urgency (no country lives within them), but the report does not develop detailed boundary-based governance mechanisms beyond referencing the science as a constraint on prosperity metrics.

- Context/synthesis: The report uses planetary boundaries to emphasize systemic overshoot and motivate a redefinition of prosperity and action timelines. 

> Currently, no country is delivering what its citizens need without transgressing the biophysical planetary boundaries.
>
> *(Summary)*


- Context/synthesis: It calls for consumption-based accounting and alternative indicators aligned with sustainability goals—steps consistent with boundary-aware governance—though specific boundary thresholds and allocative rules are not elaborated. 

> National statistics offices should more widely adopt consumption‑based accounting... and national governments should set goals and strategies for reducing footprints...
>
> *(Recommendations – Align national statistics with sustainability goals)*

## Score 1: Token Acknowledgement

### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### GOVUK22: What is environmental degradation, what are its causes, and how to respond?

- **Organisation**: IDS (ESRC/FCDO)
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because planetary boundaries are mentioned as part of a Malthusian scarcity narrative used in policy debates, but not substantively developed or endorsed by the author; they are cited primarily as an example in a critical overview.

- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> With the spectre of climate change rising up the agenda, this narrative has revived in recent years, and wider debates about ‘planetary boundaries’ feed into discussions around the limits of human activity across a range of environmental dimensions (Rockström et al. 2009).
>
> *(4.1 Narrative 1)*


- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> There are of course many assumptions embedded in this framing, not least the understanding of ‘scarcity’... and ‘limits’... Some of the other narratives about environmental degradation respond to these questions.

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### UNLAND17_1: The Global Land Outlook: Part 1 - The Big Picture

- **Organisation**: UNCCD
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because the report explicitly mentions planetary boundaries to frame urgency, but it does not develop it conceptually nor propose mechanisms or indicators based on that framework.

- Planetary boundaries are invoked once in setting the urgency context, without elaboration or operationalization: 

> While we are at a critical juncture, fast approaching and in some cases surpassing planetary boundaries, the evidence presented in this first edition of the Global Land Outlook demonstrates that informed and responsible decision-making, improved land management policies and practices, and simple changes in our everyday lives, can, if widely adopted, help to reverse the current worrying trends in the state of our land resources.

#### UNLEGAL: Environmental rule of law: tracking progress and charting future directions

- **Organisation**: UNEP
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because planetary boundaries are explicitly mentioned in a figure header but not developed as a framework in the analysis; there is no substantive engagement or application.

- The concept is referenced textually in a nexus figure but without further discussion or operationalization: 

> GLOBAL CHANGE . SUSTAINABLE PROSPERITY . PLANETARY BOUNDARIES
>
> *(Chapter 2, Figure 2.8 caption/header: Water Energy Food Nexus)*

#### EUONEHEALTH24: One Health governance in the European Union

- **Organisation**: SAPEA
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because planetary boundaries are explicitly referenced in the discussion of Planetary Health indicators and limits, but not further developed into a One Health instrument here.

- The report connects Planetary Health’s KPI logic to planetary boundaries and considers how One Health might shift these views: 

> Planetary Health uses key performance indicators to measure where human existence itself is called into question based on exceeding planetary boundaries. We hope to integrate and shift this view... into an expansive, non-anthropocentric definition of health...
>
> *(One Health definition – Synergies with other terms)*


- The reference is conceptual, framing the boundary conditions rather than prescribing boundary-based EU mechanisms within One Health: 

> We want to be careful not to trivialise the issues at stake by becoming stuck in terminological differences.
>
> *(One Health definition – Synergies with other terms)*
