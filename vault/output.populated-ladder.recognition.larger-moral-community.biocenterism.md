### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### UNSECURITY24: Envisioning security for a more-than-human world

- **Organisation**: UNDP
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the paper explicitly invokes biocentric environmental ethics (Taylor 1986), arguing humans are one part of a wider living matrix, and explores implications for reimagining security and governance, though it remains at conceptual/policy guidance level. - It names biocentrism and its import: “The deontological tradition of environmental ethics, for example, challenges anthropocentrism by defining the environment beyond something that simply holds a ‘value function’ for humans. Taylor (1986), for instance, sets out why a biocentric conceptualization of nature, in which humans are but one part, is vital in considering questions of how to safeguard the planet.” (Extending the human security concept) - It articulates the more-than-human matrix: “The Earth, as Abram reasons, is ‘an intertwined matrix’ of human and non-human worlds, despite our social conditioning to think of ourselves as somehow ‘separate, autonomous, independent’ of ‘bodily nature’.” (Extending the human security concept) - It extends to security strategy: “In securing the future of the planet, nurturing collective solidarity is vital... communicating persuasively is increasingly pivotal... as we sit on the precipice of human and environmental precarity on a planetary scale.” (Communications and solidarity sections)

## Score 2: Theoretical Treatment

### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### UNESCOBIO11: Ethics and biodiversity

- **Organisation**: UNESCO
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because Biocentrism is explicitly presented as a named ethical approach (including Paul Taylor’s and Schweitzer’s work) with discussion of duties and potential implications for biodiversity, but the text remains descriptive and does not translate biocentrism into concrete, enforceable institutional designs or policy mechanisms that empower nonhumans in decision-making.

- Context/synthesis: The document introduces biocentrism and traces its key principles and revival, explicating inherent worth of all beings and links to biodiversity preservation: 

> Biocentrism contends the inherent worth of all members of the biosphere... The resurgence of biocentrism is linked to the desire to balance the anthropocentric ideals which some see as being the cause of the current environmental crisis.
>
> *(2.3 Biocentrism)*


- Context/synthesis: It details Taylor’s biocentric egalitarianism and the duties implied, directly tying moral obligations to species protection, integrity of ecosystems, and anti-pollution stances (conceptual implications but not institutional mechanisms): 

> Taylor... puts forth the idea that... ‘We are morally bound to protect or promote their good for their sake’. Taylor goes on to provide ways... duties may include a respect for the integrity of natural ecosystems, to preserve endangered species, and avoid environmental pollution...
>
> *(2.4 Biocentric Egalitarianism)*


- Context/synthesis: The report recognizes meta-ethical challenges and anthropomorphism concerns in applying biocentrism, underscoring that the treatment is theoretical rather than operationalized in governance: 

> These meta-ethical dilemmas can stem from our inherent lack of ability to perceive the potential ethical concerns of other life forms... virtues cannot be imposed in egalitarian theories without clear problems of anthropomorphizing...
>
> *(2.4 Biocentric Egalitarianism)*

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### EUSTI50: S&T&I for 2050: science, technology and innovation for ecosystem performance – accelerating sustainability transitions

- **Organisation**: EC DG R&I
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because biocentrism appears as an explicit ethical framing in the 'Immersing & Caring' perspective and in scenario narratives, but it is used to set aspirations rather than propose concrete empowerment instruments distinct from rights‑based reforms.

- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> These 'collectives' receive uncommon names such as 'pluriverse', 'Gaia', odd‑kin or zoe/geo/techno‑spheres... The notion of 'Multi‑species‑justice' provides a justice theory... various ethical theories like 'biocentrism', or deep ecology offer frameworks for ethical deliberation around the intrinsic worth and value of nature.
>
> *(2.3 Caring within hybrid collectives)*


- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> This scenario has emerged... building on... Indigenous legal thinking about land such as property as 'curation', property as making kin... property is seen as entering into a treaty with a place or ecosystem, rather than owning it.
>
> *(4.2.3 Land use adapting to nature – Scenario P3)*

#### EUHRPLAN21: Human rights for the planet

- **Organisation**: Council of Europe
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because biocentrism is explicitly defined and connected to jurisprudence, with discussion of whether European human rights law could incorporate such visions; however, it remains theoretical and not operationalized for nonhuman empowerment in Europe.

- Biocentrism is directly defined and linked to court practice: 

> According to one understanding of ‘biocentrism’, the environment’s value is measured with regards to the utility and availability of natural resources not only to current but also to future generations, as well as to a wider (global) human community... Pursuant to another definition, ‘biocentrism’ is a type of ‘ecocentrism’, and as such, it is concerned with the protection of living components of the environment because of their intrinsic value, regardless of any utility to humans.
>
> *(Overview of ECtHR environmental case-law)*


- The European court is asked to consider immersive anthropocentric/biocentric visions: 

> is there a room in the European human rights law for a biocentric or immersive anthropocentric vision that entails a recognition that the well-being or the lives of individuals in current and future generations greatly depend on ecosystem services?
>
> *(Overview of ECtHR environmental case-law)*
