# COMPLEX_UNPRED: Complex unpredictability

## Sources and Questions

### ISCHEALTH21: Urban health and wellbeing in the Anthropocene: interdisciplinary science-action plan 2021–2025

**Question**: How should decisions be made under radical uncertainty and limited predictability in complex urban-planetary health systems?

**Evidence**: 

> Understanding them requires the recognition that we are also in an era of post-normal science... it is necessary to identify and accept the limits of scientific knowledge and find ways to make decisions in an uncertain world we cannot predict and understand. Redundancy, diversity, precaution and building collective intelligence are some strategies which have been proposed in response to those limits to knowledge.

### UNESCOEDU21: Reimagining our futures together: a new social contract for education

**Question**: How can education address interlinked, unpredictable disruptions (climate, technology, governance, work) while being transformative itself?

**Evidence**: “Despite the uncertainty of foresight work, anticipating transformative shifts provides a foundation on which to plan... The decades leading to 2050... will be pivotal for the future of humans and all other life forms on Earth.” (Part I, Chapter 2: Disruptions and emerging transformations)

### UNLAND17_2: The Global Land Outlook: Part 2 - The Outlook

**Question**: How can policy and practice account for the complex, heterogeneous, and unpredictable impacts of climate change on food and water systems?

**Evidence**: 

> Most studies focus on availability, whereas related issues of stability of supply, distribution, and access may all be affected by a changing climate. Low-income producers and consumers are likely to suffer the most... impacts on food systems will be complex, geographically and temporally variable, and heavily influenced by socio-economic conditions.

### IPBESTCA3: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 3. How transformative change occurs

**Question**: How to plan interventions under complexity with emergent, unexpected outcomes and nonlinear feedbacks?

**Evidence**: “Transformative change is a complex and multi-faceted process... often in unpredictable ways... it cannot be executed according to a blueprint. Instead, it requires continuous and iterative monitoring, evaluation, learning and adaptation.” (Executive summary point 2; 3.2.1, p. 105-106, 112)

### LANCETFOOD19: Food in the Anthropocene: the EAT–Lancet Commission on healthy diets from sustainable food systems

**Question**: How do we manage implementation under high uncertainty and complex Earth system dynamics when setting and using global food-system boundaries?

**Evidence**: “However, the uncertainty range for these food boundaries remains high because of the inherent complexity in Earth system dynamics.” (Executive summary)
“Boundaries that define a safe operating space for food systems are difficult to set in complex systems… All scientific targets for a safe operating space… are therefore associated with uncertainty.” (Safe operating space for food systems)

### SIPSECURITY21: Anthropocene (in)securities: reflections on collective survival 50 years after Stockholm

**Question**: How can security practice respond to the unpredictability and non-linear risks of the Anthropocene, where environmental tipping points and cascading insecurities are emergent and uncertain?

**Evidence**:  

> The proposition that we now live on a radically transformed and damaged planet is uncomfortable and troubling... it invites us to mourn what has been lost and to grapple with the unpredictable and fragile environments...

### IMFNAT: Embedded in nature: nature-related economic and financial risks and policy considerations

**Question**: Nature–climate interactions include tipping points and cascading effects that are difficult to model and create macro-financial uncertainty.

**Evidence**: “Deep interlinkages between climate change and nature loss can exacerbate threats to the global economy and financial system... cascading nature‑climate impacts. Catastrophic nature‑climate outcomes or 'endgames'... are plausible scenarios that are very hard to quantify, and therefore dangerously unexplored.” (Background)
“Nature‑related risks could transmit to the financial sector through five main channels... Sudden changes in expectations... devaluation/revaluation of assets... could lead to a systemic financial crisis.” (Conceptual framework: Macro‑financial linkages)

### UNGEOETHICS22: Concept note of the World Commission on the Ethics of Scientific Knowledge and Technology (COMEST) on the ethics of climate engineering

**Question**: What precautionary principles should govern action or inaction under deep scientific and policy uncertainty?

**Evidence**: “Since climate engineering has the potential for enormous impact... it seems an obvious case in need of precautionary considerations... a more appropriate principle... should be the ‘pro-actionary’ principle... promoting proactive intervention while continuously monitoring... The case of climate engineering is a prime case for exploring alternative formulations of the precautionary principle.” (IV. Governance challenges)

### IUCNWILD16: Wilderness protected areas: management guidelines for IUCN Category 1b protected areas

**Question**: Climate change introduces uncertainty and necessitates balancing passive vs active interventions.

**Evidence**: “There is little that managers can actually do to ameliorate the wider impacts of climate change... Such resilience may best come from the rewilding, restoration and passive management of wilderness areas... managers may need to intervene and assist adaptation processes.” (4.7)
