### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### IPBESTCA4: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 4. Overcoming the challenges of achieving transformative change

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because decolonial critique of dominant worldviews (modernity/coloniality) and the marginalization of Indigenous and local knowledge is central to the chapter’s argument, and the chapter explores conceptual implications and practice-oriented pathways (active disruption, co-creation, inclusive governance) even if not prescribing detailed institutional steps. - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> The relationship between people and biodiversity is characterized by a prevailing world view marked by a propensity to adopt more rigidly categorical views of people, nature and the world... This world view reflects forms of modernity shaped by colonialism... which extend into the present as parts of a globalizing formation of modernity/coloniality.
>
> *(4.2.1)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Prevailing relations of domination rest on and enable systems of simplification and quantification intended to make complex realities legible and manageable (Scott, 1998)... [They] also reduce complex socio-ecologies into singular understandings of their value that tend to reinforce the underlying relations of domination.
>
> *(4.2.1)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> The marginalization of Indigenous and local worldviews, knowledges and practices, and their lack of recognition, hinder transformative change (well established)... The dominant focus on market-led development and investment promotes the reduction of nature to a single economic value, thereby marginalizing other ways of valuing nature and biodiversity... In contexts where environmental impact assessments legitimize extractive development, the participation of Indigenous Peoples in these assessments often requires their adoption of language and assumptions that clash with and obscure their values and views.
>
> *(Executive Summary point 9; 4.2.1; 4.2.3)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Overcoming the challenges to transformative change demands active disruption and careful phase-out actions... Policy, programme and project design... involves strategies and context-specific actions that empower new views, structures and practices... For example... The Len Ko Winkul Mapu initiative... elaborated a conservation plan to strengthen its resistance to several industrial projects...
>
> *(Executive Summary point 10; 4.3)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Transforming biodiversity conservation and restoration involves empowering new views, structures and practices... practices and processes that engage Indigenous Peoples and local communities in a collaborative, just and equitable manner may create an institutional space for multiple ways of thinking, doing, organizing, relating and knowing... reducing power asymmetries and overcoming the categories and hierarchies that devalue Indigenous and local knowledges...
>
> *(4.3)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Connected to this, empowering different ways of repairing and including diverse knowledges of Indigenous Peoples and local communities may be overcoming separation and exclusion of these communities in planning and policy... This, in turn, may address the relations of domination that often relegate such diverse knowledge to the background of policy conversations.
>
> *(4.3)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> One vehicle for such work lies in education systems that enable and mobilize alternative worldviews and epistemological paradigms as valid and appropriate ways of understanding and living in/with/as nature.
>
> *(4.3)*

 What prevents a 4: While the chapter provides practice-oriented implications (active disruption, co-creation, inclusive curricula), it does not lay out detailed, actionable institutional mechanisms (e.g., specific governance designs, stepwise protocols) to enact decolonised knowledge in decision-making across jurisdictions.

### SCENARIOS AND FUTURES EXPLORATION

#### NEHALF20: Narratives for the Half Earth and Sharing the Planet scenarios

- **Organisation**: PBL
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the report uses ‘nature as culture’ and biocultural conservation as core conceptual devices shaping the SP scenario and works through implications for governance and agriculture (shared landscapes), though it stops short of institutionalizing decolonised structures in policy. 

- Core conceptual framing: “the SP scenario has roots in both ecosystem services approaches to conservation and in the concepts of ‘living with nature’ and ‘nature as culture’... this scenario was developed in a way to integrate human and nature systems into working mixed landscapes.” (Main findings; 3.1; 2.2)

- Implications for governance and practice: “authors... favour local governance systems whereby the value of nature is primarily created locally... mosaic landscapes... low-input agro-ecology, agroforestry... social mobilisation and local actors are determinant.” (5.1.2–5.2.3)

## Score 2: Theoretical Treatment

### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### GOVUK22: What is environmental degradation, what are its causes, and how to respond?

- **Organisation**: IDS (ESRC/FCDO)
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the paper strongly foregrounds decolonised knowledge, indigenous framings (Mother Earth, Gaia), and plural epistemologies as essential to defining degradation and restoration; it is a conceptual orientation without concrete nonhuman empowerment institutions.

- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Questioning the assumptions so embedded in (largely) Western constructions of nature and environment and looking in more detail at what local people actually do and their logics of environmental care suggests a very different perspective... Different views of ‘degradation’ and ‘restoration’ for the same area co‑exist.
>
> *(3. Understanding dynamic environments)*


- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> This requires a reversal in processes of knowledge‑making and understanding, drawing from local perspectives with often quite different framings. Such ‘decolonised’ knowledge relations challenge standard modalities of intervention (Quijano 2007; Mignolo 2007) and raise questions about who controls knowledge and practice in development processes; themes long raised by feminist scholars.

#### UNSECURITY24: Envisioning security for a more-than-human world

- **Organisation**: UNDP
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the paper highlights postcolonial concerns of knowledge production and the need to include subaltern voices from the Global South and marginalized groups, aligning with decolonized knowledge approaches, but remains largely diagnostic. - It foregrounds decolonial knowledge needs: “In some ways, this is partially an old postcolonial concern of knowledge production, and the challenge is not confined to facilitating subaltern voices from the Global South to inform policy, but also from perspectives at the margins in the Global North.” (Local contextualization) - It links to governance practice: “We have seen too often... how the delineation of conservation areas... tends to ignore local histories and displace local communities. We need to be locally sensitive... Human-environmental relationships are intersectional...” (Building consensus / local agency)

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### IPBESPATHWAYS19: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 5. Realizing a sustainable world for nature and people: transformative strategies, actions and roles for all

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because ‘entanglement of natures and cultures’ is explicitly used as a theoretical foundation for Strategy 1 and Strategy 5 (decolonial approach), but the chapter does not set out a singular, consolidated policy mechanism under the banner of ‘naturecultures’.

- The chapter grounds Strategy 1 in a decolonial natureculture perspective: 

> The concepts of conservation and regeneration... are conceptualized as being embedded in a relational paradigm... It highlights the inseparable entanglement of natures and cultures and of interconnected life forms across generations... Without these considerations, strategies risk replicating relations of domination.
>
> *(5.3)*


- Strategy 5 similarly orients toward pluriversality and entanglement: 

> It also involves promoting reciprocal human-nature relations... by recognizing the agency... as spiritual beings and kin.
>
> *(5.7; 5.7.1)*
