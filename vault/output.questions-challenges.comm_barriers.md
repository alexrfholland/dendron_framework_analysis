### IPBESTCA3: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 3. How transformative change occurs

**Question**: How to weave diverse knowledge systems (including ILK) and approaches without talking past each other?

### EUINVASIVE24: IPBES Invasive Alien Species Assessment: Chapter 1. Introducing Biological Invasions and the IPBES Thematic Assessment of Invasive Alien Species and Their Control

**Question**: How do differences in public and expert risk perceptions and limited public awareness affect IAS management and policy uptake?

**Evidence**: - Context/synthesis: The chapter documents low public awareness and diverging perceptions compared to experts. “Knowledge of public awareness of invasive alien species is still quite limited... members of the public ranked invasive alien species as 19 out of 24 ecological risk items, while professional risk assessors ranked them as ninth.” (Section 1.5.2)

- Context/synthesis: It points to the role of framing and metaphors in shaping acceptance and policy. “It is suggested that the terminology employed... should be chosen carefully... How the issue-area is framed... will have an impact on subsequent policy development.” (Section 1.5.2)

### UNTRANS25: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 1. Transformative change and a sustainable world

**Question**: How can cross-community communication overcome linguistic and epistemic translation losses, particularly for Indigenous and local knowledge?

**Evidence**: “Translating text from other languages into English is likely to result in a loss of its original meaning... in many cases, Indigenous and local knowledge is documented by non-native, non-indigenous researchers, which can result in further loss of meaning. This assessment recognizes and acknowledges these limitations.” (Box 1.5 Lost in Translation)

### GEAURBANGREEN23: Tackling the Climate and Biodiversity Crises in Europe through Urban Greening Plans

**Question**: How can cities ensure early, co-creative stakeholder participation to build ownership, transparency, and acceptance for more nature- and biodiversity-positive urban plans?

**Evidence**: - Context/synthesis: The report identifies limited public involvement and inadequate communication as political barriers and prescribes early, co-creative participation strategies. 

> Lack of involvement of citizens in decision making processes and co-design of NbS; need for better communication and information (communicable targets and commitments) to increase ownership, transparency and acceptance of solutions;
>
> *(Annex II, Table 1)*


- Context/synthesis: It recommends a participation strategy and narrative guidelines to raise awareness of ecological and social benefits. 

> UGP need to include a participation strategy for all relevant actors and should be accompanied by a communication-/narrative guideline to raise awareness about ecological and social benefits of NbS... Co-creation should therefore be engrained as a guiding principle...
>
> *(Section 5, Recommendation 2)*

### UNSECURITY24: Envisioning security for a more-than-human world

**Question**: What communications strategies can build global solidarity for more-than-human security, linking futurescaping with concrete asks?

**Evidence**: “Influencing the global response to the insecurities of climate change is first and foremost a communications challenge... we need to be especially conscious of the requirement to reductively and creatively communicate... We need to link crystal-clear delineations of future insecurities with necessary action now.” (Communications and futurescaping)
