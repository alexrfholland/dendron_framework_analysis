# CULTURAL_ACCEPT: Cultural acceptance

## Sources and Questions

### UNLAND17_3: The Global Land Outlook: Part 3 - A More Secure Future

**Question**: How can differing cultural histories and norms (e.g., traditions of individualism versus collective integration) be navigated to build acceptance for landscape-scale cooperation and negotiation?

**Evidence**: “The willingness of communities to consider such approaches differs markedly around the world. In historical landscapes, with generations of interaction and collaboration, such integration is understood at an intrinsic or cultural level and will be relatively easy. In more recently settled areas, or cultures with a history of individualism, major social and cultural changes may be needed before the idea of community-wide cooperation is accepted or achievable.” (Part Three – Response 1: Multifunctional landscapes)

### ICNATUREPOS24: Blueprint for a Nature-Positive Adelaide

**Question**: How can resistance to changing practices be reduced to enable biodiversity-sensitive urban transformations?

Demonstration sites can ameliorate resistance to change... after the initial section was complete, the residents could see the potential of the native landscaping to enhance the amenity value of their street and were eager to have the design replicated for their footpaths.” (Figure 11 Barriers; Section 6.6)

### IUCNBUILD25: Catalysing biodiversity on buildings: a review of supporting initiatives in European cities

**Question**: How can biodiversity interventions respect historic preservation while enabling multispecies cohabitation?
