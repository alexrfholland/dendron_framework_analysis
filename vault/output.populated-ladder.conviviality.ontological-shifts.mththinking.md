### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### UNESCOEDU20: Learning to become with the world: education for future survival

- **Organisation**: Common Worlds/UNESCO
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Humanities/Ethics

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the text treats more-than-human thinking as foundational (agency as relational and distributed, cosmopolitical education) and explores implications across ethics, pedagogy and governance; it proposes criteria (learning with the world, distributed agency) but not detailed implementation policies. - They explicitly teach and enact more-than-human agency and thinking: 

> We are teaching that agency is relational, collectively distributed, and more-than-human... we began the enormous task of radically reconfiguring our curricula and pedagogies in accordance with more-than-human, collective, and relational notions of agency.
>
> *(Visionary declarations, 3)*

 - They define learning as ‘with’ the world rather than about it, embedding more-than-human cognition: 

> We now proceed with an ecological consciousness that firmly repositions all humans as ecological insiders... possibilities for collaborative and collective more-than-human learning with the world.
>
> *(Visionary declarations, 5)*

 - They adopt cosmopolitical education to pluralize thought beyond human-only standpoints: 

> Educators now fully embrace the principles of cosmopolitics... acknowledge both the multiplicity of interconnected worlds and our entanglements in multispecies ecologies that include different knowledges, practices, and technologies.
>
> *(Visionary declarations, 6)*

 - The report links more-than-human thinking to goals and trajectories (UN name change, pluriverse making): 

> It has become clear that the answer to this question can only be enacted through the process of commoning: of humans becoming with Earth others, as we all recompose worlds together.
>
> *(Visionary declarations, 7)*

#### UNSECURITY24: Envisioning security for a more-than-human world

- **Organisation**: UNDP
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the paper’s central argument is to envision and enact security for a more-than-human world, extending human security conceptually to include nonhuman worlds, and it explores implications for metrics, governance, health, and communications, but without creating a detailed institutional design. - It explicitly reframes security beyond humans: “In seeking to reimagine, reframe and re-resource strategies of security, the paper conceptualizes a conjoined sense of human-environmental security, which extends the human security concept to address more holistically the overlapping precarities of our human and non-human worlds... the task of envisioning and enacting security for a more-than-human world.” (Abstract / Introduction) - It grounds the ontological shift and implications: “Post-COVID-19, we must project a sense of security for a more-than-human planet and thereby frame a picture of interconnected human-environmental precarity... transcending anthropocentric conceptualizations of security is key.” (Extending the human security concept) - It links to outcomes and indicators: “We need to strategize the ‘indicators’ of security we elevate and measure... the ‘planetary pressures-adjusted HDI’... reimagining the human development journey as one in which the expanding human freedoms also ease planetary pressures.” (Building consensus / metrics section)

### IMPLEMENTATION AND METRICS

#### D4C25: Design for Environmental Conservation (Toolkit)

- **Organisation**: None
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Design/Engineering

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the book explicitly reorients design cognition to more-than-human mindsets (“think like nature would”), detailing implications for practice (tools, facilitation, ethics), though it is not a policy instrument per se. 

- Conceptual guidance: “Before diving into the Design for Conservation methodology, it’s essential that we first align on a shared set of values and mental models… transforming the way we think about environmental challenges… Think Like Nature Would.” (Ch.4)

- Practical implications: “More-than-human, multispecies mindsets… Systemic… Balanced… Cyclic… Relative… provide a foundation for aligning human creativity with the wisdom of natural systems.” (Ch.4)

- Implementation across the method: “The (Re)Connect phase… builds the foundation for authentic, innovative problem-solving… with the natural world around them… climate game, rituals, field trips.” (Ch.6)

- Outcomes: “This mindset… shapes design choices… ensures delivery mechanisms—Service Blueprint, Impact Planning—are nature-aligned.” (Ch.4, Ch.8–9)

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### SIPSECURITY21: Anthropocene (in)securities: reflections on collective survival 50 years after Stockholm

- **Organisation**: SIPRI
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the book explicitly advances a post-human, entangled ontology as the core conceptual mechanism for reimagining security, and works through implications for institutions, ethics, and legal reforms (e.g., decentering human subject, caring for nonhuman worlds), while not prescribing a single legal blueprint.

- Context/synthesis: It calls for a post-human orientation that decenters the human and recognizes the agency/rights of nonhuman worlds, using this to critique and reconstruct security paradigms. 

> This chapter traces an arc... from a state-centric and anthropocentric vision... to a post-human and ecological one... A ‘post-human’ perspective accepts that humankind cannot stand above or apart from nature... acknowledges the intrinsic rights of non-human nature to flourish and exist apart from human use...
>
> *(Chapter 7 – Introduction)*


- Context/synthesis: It articulates an entangled, worldly account of security that binds human and nonhuman worlds together, and derives policy directions (solidarity, care, coexistence) from this ontology. 

> Rather than offering a blueprint for action, the Anthropocene invites us to mourn what has been lost and to grapple with the unpredict able and fragile environments... the idea that we can secure humanity against external threats is precisely the problem that needs to be overcome... the ‘set of conditions in which all beings co‑constitute one another’.
>
> *(Chapters 1 and 8 – One earth, multiple worlds; Whose security?)*


- Context/synthesis: The volume develops outcomes and goals (e.g., plural security tied to SDGs, cooperation, care, and peaceful coexistence as instruments), connecting ontological shifts to indicators/criteria for success. 

> We make the case for a holistic, lived and plural sense of security, oriented towards solidarity and kinship across species, cultures, generations and worlds.
>
> *(Afterword – Trajectories for security)*

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### UKHYDRO22: Written evidence (LUE0078) to the Land Use in England Committee inquiry

- **Organisation**: UKCEH
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: STEM

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the submission embeds an ecocentric lens within a four-lens decision framework and recommends governance structures that give equal weight to an ecocentric (more-than-human) perspective, with implications for planning and policy design.

- It proposes a multi-lens framework including an ecocentric lens to inform sustainable land-use decisions: 

> The framework suggests that sustainable and equitable land-use decisions are most likely to be achieved by examining any given land-use dilemma through four different lenses... iv) Ecocentric, which contributes information on the multifaceted behaviour of the ecosystem as a whole, including the responses of species and natural processes across multiple spatial and temporal scales.
>
> *(Q1 Response)*


- It recommends governance to institutionalise this lens with parity to economic/power and cultural lenses: 

> Making effective use of all four lenses requires governance structures that give equal weight to all lenses, enable dialogue and coexistence between top down and bottom up approaches... permit adaptation to local and granular place-specifics...
>
> *(Q1 Response)*


- It connects the ecocentric lens to decision support (data, monitoring) and policy outcomes (resilience, conflict minimisation), showing practical implications: 

> Key to achieving this goal will be the provision to all stakeholders of freely available, high quality and detailed data on land use, land management, and the status of natural capital and biodiversity... Accurate and robust monitoring of the outcomes...
>
> *(Q3 Response)*

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### SCTRANSS25: Environment strategy for Scotland – transformative changes for sustainability

- **Organisation**: Scottish Government
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because more-than-human/relational thinking is a core conceptual device used to reframe policy goals and is tied to explicit implications and practice pathways (education, arts, research, place-based work), though not a single codified regulation.

- The report devotes a major section to relationality as a turn that decentre humans and recognise nonhuman agency, senses, and labour: 

> Relationality... proposes a new understanding of the nature of reality... human-nature relations are deeply entangled and interdependent... recognising the agency, subjectivities, experiences, senses... of non-humans...
>
> *(3.3 Emerging approaches – Relationality)*


- It outlines concrete application domains (education curricula, community arts, transdisciplinary research), translating the concept into steps: 

> Embed environment across education and mobilise relationality and more-than-human insights... promote celebration and awe... Mobilise relationality insights in research and action research... Support speculative futures exploration by artists...
>
> *(Table 3: Social and cultural instruments; Radical and speculative future-making)*


- It explicitly links the ontological shift to outcomes and criteria (ethics of care, reciprocity, collective wellbeing), setting values for success: 

> Transformative change in relationality is associated with ethical shifts – towards ethics of care across all relations... regenerative relationships that contribute to collective wellbeing...
>
> *(3.3 Emerging approaches – Relationality)*


- It discusses implications, risks, and feasibility, including the need for plural imaginaries and decolonising research, showing the consequences of adopting this framework: 

> Amplifying relational thinking requires new speculative imaginaries... decolonising research practice is important... address which forms of knowledge are valued...
>
> *(3.3; 7.3)*

## Score 2: Theoretical Treatment

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### IPBESTCA3: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 3. How transformative change occurs

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the chapter consistently frames transformation in relational, more-than-human terms (mutually constitutive human–more-than-human relationships) and integrates such thinking in approaches, but does not present a standalone, operational ‘more-than-human thinking’ program. - Context/synthesis: The assessment emphasizes relational ontologies, diversifying ways of knowing and seeing beyond human exceptionalism. 

> Indigenous and local knowledge systems have particularly rich insights to offer, given their long historical foundations and deep relationships with nature... Diversifying ways of knowing, seeing and thinking.
>
> *(Executive summary points 3 and 3.5.2, p. 105, 135)*


- Context/synthesis: The empowerment and inner transformation approaches highlight nonhuman relations as core to change. 

> Transformative change... moving away from relationships characterized by extraction and control of nature... mutually constitutive human- and more-than-human relationships.
>
> *(3.2.3, p. 117)*


- Context/synthesis: These conceptual moves support frameworks like RoN and personhood but are not codified as a distinct policy framework.

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### UNESCOEDU21: Reimagining our futures together: a new social contract for education

- **Organisation**: UNESCO
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because it discusses rebalancing with the living planet and relearning interdependencies, including understanding humans as ecological beings, but it stops short of deeply developing more-than-human cognitive or governance practices. - It acknowledges the need to relearn interdependence and human place in a more-than-human world: 

> We must urgently rebalance our relationships with each other, with the living planet, and with technology. We must relearn our interdependencies and our human place and agency in a more-than-human world.
>
> *(Introduction)*

 - It proposes curricular ecological learning: 

> Curricula should emphasize ecological, intercultural and interdisciplinary learning that supports students to access and produce knowledge while also developing their capacity to critique and apply it.
>
> *(Chapter 4)*

## Score 1: Token Acknowledgement

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### EUONEHEALTH24: One Health governance in the European Union

- **Organisation**: SAPEA
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because the report explicitly invokes more-than-human thinking through Haraway’s sympoiesis and Indigenous ecosystem philosophies, but it is used conceptually rather than as a formal framework with its own mechanisms.

- The report embraces more-than-human conceptual language to reorient ontology and governance: 

> We take inspiration from transhumanist and posthumanist philosophy, and more radical framings; these include that of... Donna Haraway, whose philosophy... emphasises sympoiesis (becoming together)... 'more-than-human'... we emphasise that such an 'ecosystem philosophy' is original to many Indigenous perspectives...
>
> *(One Health definition – 'Ecosystem' and 'environment')*


- This guides the ontological shift that informs One Health but is not separately operationalised.
