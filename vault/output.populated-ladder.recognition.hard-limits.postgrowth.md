# Post-growth economies (steady state, degrowth, circular economy, etc)

## Score 4: Actionable Mechanisms

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### SCTRANSS25: Environment strategy for Scotland – transformative changes for sustainability

- **Organisation**: Scottish Government
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because post-growth is central to the economic recommendations and is operationalised with detailed, actionable mechanisms (e.g., tax reform, ownership changes, work-time reduction, ending planned obsolescence, anti-monopoly measures, public procurement), providing concrete policy pathways.

- The report positions post-growth as a deep leverage point and lays out granular policy instruments for both demand and supply sides: 

> Addressing growth dependency (demand side) ... work-time reduction initiatives, job guarantees, universal basic services and variations on basic income... Redesign economies (supply side) via taxation, equitable ownership, action on rent-seeking... scaling back ecologically destructive industries and bringing under public control, cutting advertising, ending planned obsolescence, improved urban planning.
>
> *(Table 3: Economic and financial policy levers)*


- It specifies governance and fiscal measures, including anti-trust and financial architecture reforms, to enable post-growth transitions: 

> Explore options for redesigning financial architecture... Legal measures to tackle large corporate concentration such as anti-monopoly regulation.
>
> *(Table 3: Economic & Legal levers)*


- It details institutional supports (education, procurement, legal frameworks) to scale alternatives (commons, cooperatives), tightly linking policies to nonhuman flourishing: 

> Support ‘commoning’ policy levers to create an enabling environment for the expansion of cooperatives, social enterprises, public-cooperative models (e.g. public procurement... community currency and credit approaches). Promote assessment of wellbeing (human, non-human) in national indicators...
>
> *(Table 3: Prefigure & expand alternative economies)*


- The report explicitly addresses consequences and trade-offs (e.g., decoupling limits, political feasibility, inequality), using evidence to justify these mechanisms: 

> Green growth arguments are challenging, because evidence suggests that decoupling is not happening on necessary scales and speed... The equitable degrowth movement... seeks constraints on consumption in high consumption nations...
>
> *(5. Systemic constraints; 7.1 Economic and financial policy instruments)*

## Score 3: Core Conceptual Device / Implications Explored

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### EIVIS23: Exploring new visions for a sustainable bioeconomy

- **Organisation**: JRC, EC
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because post-growth/degrowth is a central, named framework in Chapter 4 with explicit implications and concrete proposals (e.g., four-day week, wealth tax), but focused on human institutions; its environmental empowerment for nonhumans is through reduced pressure rather than direct representation. - Context/synthesis: The chapter interrogates green growth feasibility and advances degrowth strategies as necessary for staying within planetary limits. 

> There is increasing evidence that genuine green growth is not happening and is unlikely to happen in the near future... the only global pandemic recovery path that would be aligned with the 2°C global warming goal, includes zero GDP growth in the Global North.
>
> *(p. 23-25)*


- Context/synthesis: It develops outcomes and concrete reforms, showing policy implications. 

> Kallis et al. (2020) identified four “non-reformist” reforms... 1) A Green New Deal without growth; 2) Universal Care Income; 3) A Four-day Workweek; 4) Wealth tax.
>
> *(p. 26)*


- Context/synthesis: The framing explicitly links to ecological boundaries and biodiversity impacts (land sparing, reduced extraction), thus benefiting more-than-human life. 

> These interrelated crises... have the same origins inherent and embedded in the extractivist and colonial logics... reducing the economic growth in high-income countries... implies reduction in root causes of injustice and violence.
>
> *(p. 36-37)*

#### IPBSVALUES22: Summary for policymakers of the methodological assessment of the diverse values and valuation of nature

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the assessment develops ‘degrowth’ and related post-growth pathways as core options to mobilize sustainability-aligned values, works through consequences and trade-offs, and integrates them into policy guidance and scenario analysis. - Degrowth is identified as a pathway with distinct underlying values and implications: “The ‘degrowth’ pathway emphasizes strategies that reduce the material throughput of society... protecting human well-being through equitable distribution of material wealth rather than growth...” (Box SPM 3) - It clarifies the value-base and expected outcomes: “Alternative pathways are underpinned by different broad and specific values of nature... The green economy... degenerates; Degrowth is underpinned by values of sufficiency and egalitarianism...” (Figure SPM 6; Box SPM 3) - The report shows how pathways interact with indicators and policy (valuation, governance, instruments): “Working with a combination of four values-based leverage points... may catalyse transformation towards sustainable and just futures.” (KM9) - It links to decision-making criteria and societal goals (norms/goals shift away from growth): “Putting sustainability at the heart of decision-making can be supported by redefining ‘development’ and ‘good quality of life’...” (KM8)

#### EUTRANS24: Mapping ERC frontier research: addressing climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution

- **Organisation**: ERC
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because post-growth is a central conceptual pathway in the report (dedicated section and multiple projects) that develops implications and strategies (equitable North–South convergence, provisioning systems, policy proposals) for transformative change, even if the document does not legislate mechanisms itself.

- Context/synthesis: The report distinguishes post-growth from green growth and argues empirically why deep decoupling is unlikely, building the case for policy alternatives at the heart of transformation. 

> Post-growth perspectives argue for the need to significantly rethink and change our economic system... They point out that there is no empirical evidence to suggest that fully decoupling from resource use can be achieved on a global scale... fully decoupling from carbon emissions is highly unlikely to be achieved at a rate rapid enough...
>
> *(4.1 New economic paradigms: post-growth)*


- Context/synthesis: It showcases the REAL project to develop equitable North–South scenarios, model provisioning systems within planetary boundaries, and craft post-growth policy proposals—outcomes, goals, and criteria for success consistent with this framework. 

> The REAL project develops equitable North-South scenarios, models provisioning systems and well-being scenarios within planetary boundaries, and viable post-growth policy proposals.
>
> *(4.1)*


- Context/synthesis: It also mobilizes PROSPERA and N-EXTLAW to redefine innovation and legal frameworks beyond growth, indicating a coherent research-policy trajectory. 

> PROSPERA explores under which conditions science, technology and innovation can flourish without being tied to the need for economic growth... N-EXTLAW theorises that by creating an appropriate legal framework, non-extractive and sustainable economic activities can be promoted...
>
> *(4.1)*

## Score 2: Theoretical Treatment

### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### ROMEECO22: Transforming our economies from ego to eco

- **Organisation**: Club of Rome
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because post-growth approaches (degrowth, circular economy, wellbeing economy) are explicitly connected and advocated as part of the economic intervention, but without concrete mechanisms that specifically empower nonhumans in decision-making.

- The paper explicitly brings together post-growth approaches: 

> connect some of the most important approaches to rethinking economics – including Doughnut Economics, Green Growth, De-Growth and Wellbeing Economics – into an emerging framework for transformational awareness-based systems change.
>
> *(p. 8–9)*


- It proposes redirecting capital flows toward regeneration of commons, again conceptually: 

> Redesign the flow of money from places where we have too much (speculation bubbles) to those where we have too little (regeneration of our ecological, social and cultural commons).
>
> *(Table 1, p. 9)*


- The author calls for a strategic support structure to shift the paradigm but provides no detailed post-growth governance reforms for more-than-human empowerment: 

> We need a similarly strategic support structure for the new economic paradigm. That will help to shift the centre of gravity of economic thought from ego system to eco system awareness.
>
> *(p. 9)*

#### EUANTHRO: Exiting the Anthropocene? Exploring fundamental change in our relationship with nature

- **Organisation**: EEA
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because post-growth pathways (degrowth, steady-state, sufficiency) are discussed as responses to boundary overshoot and injustice, but no specific post-growth institution is proposed in the briefing.

- Context/synthesis: “Developments in science and philosophy... Strong sustainability... degrowth... sufficiency... imagine human progress without economic growth (EEA, 2021b).” (p.13)

- Context/synthesis: It connects post-growth perspectives to justice (disproportionate responsibility) and to reduced resource claims: “a relatively small and wealthy group is responsible for most resource claims and ecological damage...” (p.3–4)

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### IPBESTCA2: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 2. Visions of a sustainable world – for nature and people

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because degrowth/steady-state and post-growth are explicitly described and linked to biodiversity outcomes and science–policy interfaces, with conceptual suggestions to reduce resistance (e.g., scenario use), but the chapter stops short of concrete institutional mechanisms for more-than-human empowerment.

- Explicit definition of degrowth/steady-state and biodiversity link: 

> The vision emphasizes sustainable and equitable reduction (and stabilization) of societies’ materials and energy extraction... shrinking economic activity in high-income countries... while potentially expanding other sectors that are... regenerative and opening possibilities of more autonomous pathways in low-income countries.
>
> *(Table 2.1)*


- Concrete conceptual strategy to reduce resistance is proposed (hypothetical application via scenarios), indicating implications for practice: 

> Operationalizing degrowth, steady-state, regenerative, sufficiency and other alternative economic approaches... The use of scenarios showing positive trends in economic activity, equity and biodiversity indicators alongside a non-growing Gross Domestic Product can reduce the fear of governments and businesses to post-growth visions.
>
> *(2.3.2.1)*


- Prevents higher score: proposals remain at conceptual/illustrative level; no binding policy mechanisms or governance structures are specified.

#### EUONEHEALTH24: One Health governance in the European Union

- **Organisation**: SAPEA
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report explicitly argues for degrowth/wellbeing economies as integral to One Health and explores implications and tensions with growth logics, but it does not set out an operational post-growth policy regime.

- The report explicitly situates One Health within a post-growth/wellbeing economic framing and problematises growth-based optimisation: 

> Currently, what it means to 'optimise' and 'operationalise' something is inherently capitalist... economic growth is often at odds with healthy ecosystems... In our view, a (de)growth or wellbeing economy is integral to a One Health approach.
>
> *(One Health definition – Economic considerations)*


- It discusses practical tensions and near-term strategies (incremental benefits, game-theoretical cost-effectiveness), linking the framework to decision tools: 

> Yet we recognise the short-term importance of framing things in this way and seeking optimisation in the shape of 'incremental benefits'... The literal return on investments deriving from cooperation has been demonstrated using game theoretical methodology...
>
> *(One Health definition – Economic considerations)*


- It connects to policy instruments (EU funding, Horizon, EU4Health) and governance choices that could incentivise a wellbeing economy, but without specifying a post-growth legislative package: 

> We advocate for our pragmatic approach to making use of existing infrastructures and incentives to gradually effect a paradigm shift.
>
> *(One Health definition – Economic considerations)*

#### TNBEYOND24: Analysing the beyond growth debate

- **Organisation**: TNO Publiek
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report systematically analyses degrowth/post-growth frameworks, detailing mechanisms discussed in literature (e.g., reduced work hours, redistribution, caps), and articulates research and implementation questions, but as a review rather than a policy package by TNO.

- It synthesises degrowth proposals and their mechanisms: 

> A systematic review found 50 goals, 100 objectives and 340 instruments for degrowth (2022). Most recommended objectives... Reduce time in paid waged labour... Redistribute income, wealth... Guarantee the de-commodified and universal provision of fundamental human needs...
>
> *(A.5.2; Box 4 earlier; A.5.4)*


- It develops a theory-of-change table and acknowledges missing inputs, outcomes, and scaling routes: 

> This analysis leads to a policy impact given in Table a.5... However, no concrete targets (outputs) for any of these policies are given... It also remains unclear what inputs are needed...
>
> *(A.5.4)*


- It highlights key open questions for implementation, including social norms and political feasibility: 

> How could the desired change towards ecocentric norms and values be stimulated by policy making... What would be the feasibility of such policy implementation?
>
> *(A.5.5)*

#### IPBESPATHWAYS19: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 5. Realizing a sustainable world for nature and people: transformative strategies, actions and roles for all

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because degrowth/post-growth and related ‘limits to growth’ approaches are explicitly discussed as alternative economic pathways, but the chapter does not operationalize a specific post-growth governance blueprint.

- The text categorizes alternative economic visions: 

> Limits to growth (including steady-state economy, degrowth2, and post-growth); and Wellbeing within Planetary Boundaries...
>
> *(5.5)*


- It links selective downscaling and wellbeing economies to specific policy directions: 

> Selective downscaling of production and consumption in high-income... could be effective... Instruments such as increased taxes or fines on nature-damaging activities... are options for just transformations to sustainable wellbeing economies.
>
> *(Exec. summary 6; 5.5.2)*

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### EURIGHTS: Towards an EU Charter of the Fundamental Rights of Nature

- **Organisation**: EESC
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the document critically rejects infinite growth and points toward circular/regenerative economies, but it does not present a specific post-growth program with concrete economic instruments under that label.

- Critique of growth paradigm: 

> At present law only manages the externalities and consequences of a dysfunctional system and is perpetuating the problem by supporting an unsustainable economic paradigm based on infinite growth.
>
> *(Executive Summary, p. 5)*


- Directional proposals (circularity and subsidy shifts): 

> It would no longer be legal to have an economic system based on infinite growth... giving governments a legal imperative to phase out subsidies to industries that infringe Rights of Nature and to create subsidies to scale up solutions that respect Rights of Nature.
>
> *(Section 5.5, p. 70)*

### SCENARIOS AND FUTURES EXPLORATION

#### NEHALF20: Narratives for the Half Earth and Sharing the Planet scenarios

- **Organisation**: PBL
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the SP scenario explicitly invokes a post-growth orientation (e.g., degrowth/circular) within Convivial Conservation’s proposals and acknowledges modelling limits, but does not lay out a detailed macroeconomic transition plan. 

- Post-growth orientation: “they... pledge to move towards a different economic model beyond capitalist accumulation and GDP-based economic growth... for the short term, this could be towards a circular or doughnut economy.” (5.3)

- Modelling constraint: “post-growth economy... could not be fully translated into the models... While this report attempted to conceptualise... the operationalisation... has been difficult, if not impossible.” (6, Conclusion)

---

#### NESTORIES24: Mapping and analysis of alternative growth paradigms: towards a taxonomy and storylines

- **Organisation**: MultiFutures/TNO
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because post-growth paradigms (degrowth, steady state) are central to the taxonomy and become a detailed storyline with explicit policies (e.g., consumption taxes, shorter working week), although this deliverable does not itself implement them.

- Context/synthesis: Post Growth is a distinct storyline with goals, actors, and policies (e.g., progressive consumption tax, basic income, reduced working hours): “A progressive ‘consumption tax’... might be accompanied by a reduction of taxes on labour... Other important structural changes... a basic income for all, a drastically shortened working week...” (p.46)

- Context/synthesis: The report maps the debate and includes a strong analysis of post-growth frequencies and geographical trends (figures A2.1, A2.4, etc.).

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### UNCITIES21: Global environment outlook for cities – towards green and just cities (GEO for Cities)

- **Organisation**: UNEP & UN-Habitat
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report explicitly engages post-growth ideas (qualitative growth, Jackson’s Prosperity without Growth), exploring their implications for city economies and governance, but not installing a binding post-growth policy regime.

- Concept and implications: 

> Circular urban production and consumption that emphasize qualitative rather than quantitative growth... requires not only the ideas and knowledge that can be put into practice but also a rethinking of governance.
>
> *(Chapter 4, 4.2.3)*


- References to post-growth scholarship: 

> Jackson (2016). Prosperity without growth… Jackson (2021). Post Growth: Life after Capitalism.
>
> *(Chapter 4, references within 4.2.3)*


- Link to outcomes: Reorients city goals toward well-being, equity, and reduced throughput in line with circularity targets. (Chapter 4, 4.2.1–4.2.3)
