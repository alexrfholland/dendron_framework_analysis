# Rights of Nature / Existence rights

## Score 4: Actionable Mechanisms

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### IPBESTCA3: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 3. How transformative change occurs

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because Rights of Nature is central as a transformative structural approach with detailed, actionable mechanisms and real-world cases (Ecuador’s constitution; Te Urewera, Whanganui River; Mar Menor; marine turtles), including actors, actions, ripple effects, and governance integration. - Context/synthesis: The chapter documents institutionalization of nature’s rights in constitutional and statutory law, linking to transformation approaches and showing outcomes, scaling, and actor roles. 

> In 2008, Ecuador adopted the world’s first constitution recognizing the rights of nature... This began in New Zealand, where Te Urewera received legal personhood in 2014, and followed by the Whanganui River which received these rights in 2017... In 2022, the Mar Menor lagoon in Spain became the first ecosystem in Europe with its own legal personality... Further, in 2023, marine turtles were granted legal personhood in Panama and in the Loyalty Islands, New Caledonia.
>
> *(Box 3.1, p. 113-114)*


- Context/synthesis: It provides a multi-approach integration map for Te Awa Tupua, specifying knowledge co-creation, inner transformation, structural reforms, empowerment, systems outcomes, and science/technology roles and corresponding actors—operational detail. 

> Te Awa Tupua – Navigating transformative change: river rights as an example of multi-approach integration with ripple effects worldwide... Change in laws and regulations to integrate river and resource rights into New Zealand policies... Strengthening the power of IPLCs in decision-making and movement to grant a form of legal “personhood” to rivers.
>
> *(Figure 3.3 legend, p. 115)*


- Context/synthesis: The chapter connects Rights of Nature to governance implications, potential perverse effects, and legitimacy debates, showing it is used to work through consequences. 

> While these advances align with Indigenous assertions of nature’s agency, clearly the new legal persons... will not represent themselves. Some scholars have argued that such legal actions could even have perverse influences on Indigenous identities and agendas.
>
> *(Box 3.1, p. 114)*


- Context/synthesis: The roles of ILK and empowerment approaches are intertwined with RoN, evidencing cross-cutting ethical, empirical, political, and technical dimensions. 

> Indigenous and local knowledge features in and makes important contributions to all these approaches... asserting the rights of Indigenous Peoples and local communities... recognizing their autonomy and self-determination.
>
> *(Executive summary points 4, and 3.2.4, p. 105-106, 118)*

#### EUSTI50: S&T&I for 2050: science, technology and innovation for ecosystem performance – accelerating sustainability transitions

- **Organisation**: EC DG R&I
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because Rights of Nature is treated as a central governance and legal lever in the 'Law for Nature' case, with detailed, actionable mechanisms such as guardianship models, environmental ombudspersons, litigation strategies, and policy reforms (e.g., subsidy phase‑outs, permitting reassessment) that could be implemented in practice; the chapter also develops scenarios and explicit implications for STI policy that map outcomes, institutions, indicators, and negotiation strategies.

- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Specifically, we delve into the implications for granting rights to nature in Western legal systems. By looking at what law for nature could entail, we become better able to identify and suggest amendments to current environmental laws that ostensibly seek to conserve and protect nature. From this vantage point, as well as through exploring future developments of law for nature across three different scenarios, we conclude with implications for developing science, technology and innovation (STI) themes, programs, knowledge, infrastructure, and other policies in Europe to help forestall or even buck trends in the destruction of nature as we know and rely upon it.
>
> *(4.1.1 Introduction)*


- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Affording nature personhood and legal standing in courts would theoretically allow nature to seek the cessation of exploitation, plundering, and degradation currently sanctioned by law and human governments the world over. It could also, theoretically, provide grounds for brining claims for harms and environmental damages already committed.
>
> *(4.1.2 Rights of Nature: A Brief Review)*


- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Darpö's (2021) analysis highlighted several ways in which elements of the RoN discourse might enhance European environmental law as it stands today... strengthen environmental liability and enforcement statutes... establishing Environmental Ombudspersons at the EU and national levels capable and in separate institutions to bring environmental cases to court... stiffer consequence for Member States shirking obligations of EU environmental laws.
>
> *(4.1.2, Benefits of a RoN approach)*


- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Recommendations... include: implementing requirements for pollution permits to be dynamically re‑assessed over time; for ecological impact tracing... and caps on cumulative environmental harms... establishing remediation funds to restore contaminated habitats, with resources raised from taxation of hazardous industries and breaches of environmental law.
>
> *(4.1.5 Implications for STI Policy)*


- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Rights for Nature, without Justice – Scenario P1... Rollout of law for nature entailed a significant additional administrative burden, with monitoring, analysis, accounting, legal proceedings, and restitution significantly increasing the cost of business... Some large multinational companies and governments, after a period of competing to purchase and fence off wild and restored areas, use these to generate additional revenue.
>
> *(4.1.4 Scenarios)*


- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Rights and Justice with Nature – Scenario P3... Nature guardians appointed by representative elections or administrative acts largely reject notions of 'ecosystem performance'... Ecosystem protection is supported in some places by budgets as large as military defence budgets of the early 2020s but pioneering non‑lethal – for nature -- modes of protection... Guardianships were established in the 2030s as part of a 100‑year plan...
>
> *(4.1.4 Scenarios)*


- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Such recommendations also reference the potential need to establish an Environmental Ombudsperson at EU and national levels... set of established environmental policy measures - from strict prohibitive laws to taxation – have favoured the social change.
>
> *(4.1.5 Implications for STI Policy)*

#### UNLEGAL: Environmental rule of law: tracking progress and charting future directions

- **Organisation**: UNEP
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because Rights of Nature is treated as a central, more-than-human legal framework with extensive, concrete and actionable mechanisms detailed across jurisdictions (constitutional provisions, statutes, court orders, guardianship, open standing, remedies), and the report develops implications, solutions, and governance designs that can be (and have been) implemented.

- Centrality and global spread, with concrete mechanisms and cases: 

> Since the early days of the modern environmental development, the idea of using legal personhood as a tool for protecting the environment... In recent years, the initiatives to recognize rights of nature in national legal systems has gained momentum... Bangladesh, Colombia and Uganda have joined Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Ecuador, India, New Zealand and Spain in granting legal rights to elements of the natural world.
>
> *(Chapter 4, Section 4.3.5)*


- Operational designs (guardianship, representation, open standing) that institutionalize nonhuman representation: 

> Recognizing rights of nature raises some practical questions... Different jurisdictions have taken different approaches... In Bangladesh, the Supreme Court ordered the National River Protection Commission to serve as the guardian for rivers... In New Zealand... created a new office, Te Pou Tupua, to act and speak for the river, with two individuals... This was similar to the Te Urewera Act... Another option is to allow any person to bring a case on behalf of nature through an open standing provision. This is the approach employed in the Uganda National Environmental Act.
>
> *(Chapter 4, Section 4.3.5)*


- Concrete statutory provisions enabling enforcement pathways and regulatory obligations: 

> For example, the Uganda National Environmental Act (NEA) of 2019 explicitly recognizes that nature has ‘the right to exist, persist, maintain and regenerate its vital cycles, structure, functions and its processes in evolution’. The act creates three mechanisms to implement these rights. First, it establishes that any person has a right to bring an action before a competent court... Second, it requires the government to apply the precautionary approach... Third, it provides for the designation of conservation areas...
>
> *(Chapter 4, Section 4.3.5)*


- Remedies and criteria for success in practice (injunctions, restoration, governance measures): 

> In 2021, the Constitutional Court of Ecuador interpreted its constitutional provision on rights of nature to prohibit mining... It also ordered the government to take measures to protect rights of nature in the future, including by adopting regulations relating to issuance of environmental and water licenses and developing a participatory plan for the management of Los Cedros Protected Forest.
>
> *(Chapter 4, Section 4.3.5)*


- Ethical, legal and governance implications are explicitly worked through (two approaches, instrumental vs. inherent rights) and connected to environmental rule of law outcomes: 

> The connection between rights of nature and environmental rule of law can be understood in at least two ways. The first is practical... The second approach... is based on ethics... Proponents... believe that respecting, protecting, and fulfilling rights of nature is a requirement for the environmental rule of law...
>
> *(Chapter 4, Section 4.3.5)*


- Integration with human and future generations’ rights (negotiation strategies across communities): 

> Granting rights to a river or ecosystem can benefit human communities... Recognizing environmental personhood can be a mechanism for protecting rights of current and future generations and maintaining economically valuable ecosystem services.
>
> *(Chapter 4, Section 4.3.5)*

#### IPBESPATHWAYS19: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 5. Realizing a sustainable world for nature and people: transformative strategies, actions and roles for all

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because Rights of Nature is central to Strategy 1 (Action 1.2), with explicit, actionable legal proposals (e.g., constitutional recognition, ecocide as an international crime), concrete examples (Ecuador’s Constitution), and a worked hypothetical pathway detailing steps, actors, barriers, and outcomes (e.g., UN recognition, legal prosecutions), which collectively operationalize more-than-human empowerment in governance.

- Rights of Nature is positioned as an emerging legal paradigm with explicit institutional implications: 

> A number of experts also suggest that the legal protection of biodiversity can be enhanced through nature’s rights and through recognizing ecocide as a crime... Rights of nature is increasingly seen as an emerging legal paradigm based on diverse ecological values... to overcome western and neoliberal legal models... Although its normative content remains the object of debate and its effectiveness remains to be fully proven...
>
> *(5.3.2)*


- The chapter proposes firm legal actions and enforcement mechanisms tied to RoN: 

> A transformative action would be to require by law immediate measures to conserve and restore biodiversity as a matter of human rights, nature’s rights and/or prevention of ecocide. The prohibition of ecocide could provide an additional layer of legal accountability and challenge vested interests.
>
> *(5.3.2)*


- Concrete example and outcomes: 

> Pachamama, Rights of Nature in Constitution, Ecuador (Strategy 5).
>
> *(Table 5.1)*

 and broader adoption: 

> Adoption of the Universal Declaration for the Rights of Mother Earth (2010) by Bolivia and other entities around the world contributes to a shift in cultural narratives and norms...
>
> *(5.7.2)*


- The chapter develops a RoN-based pathway with steps, actors, barriers, and outcomes: 

> This hypothetical pathway draws from the rights of nature discourse... The first step along this pathway is a general institutionalization of nature’s rights... an interim outcome could be the recognition of rights of nature by the United Nations Environment Assembly... When successfully implemented... lead to the prosecution of extractive companies for ecocide...
>
> *(5.8.1.1, Example 1)*


- It also integrates RoN into indicators and governance targets: tabled options link legal reforms and accountability (e.g., Target 14, 15, 22) to biodiversity decision-making; this situates RoN within outcomes, evaluation, and compliance architectures (Table 5.4).

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### EURIGHTS: Towards an EU Charter of the Fundamental Rights of Nature

- **Organisation**: EESC
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because the Charter proposes Rights of Nature as the central legal framework and provides detailed, actionable mechanisms (non-regression, resilience, in dubio pro natura et clima, standing, guardianship, Ombudsman/Amicus Naturae, and concrete EU legislative pathways) to implement and govern these rights across EU policy and law.

- The study makes Rights of Nature the foundational legal blueprint and sets out concrete mechanisms (pillars, structure, pathways): 

> This study proposes that this fundamental understanding is encoded in law. This will drive unified, co-ordinated action - before it is too late... An EU Fundamental Charter for the Rights of Nature (‘Charter’) can be the instrument to establish this new blueprint at the highest level of law, ensuring that the European Union leads the way... However, for the Charter to succeed it will also have to outline a unifying and harmonizing whole systems approach to its implementation.
>
> *(Executive Summary, p. 5-6)*


- Detailed institutional content and enforceable rules are provided (non-regression, resilience, in dubio pro Natura et Clima, sustainable democratic methods, reversal of burden of proof): 

> The Charter shall be based on the core elements of ‘ecological mandate’ as well as on five fundamental rules acting as necessary pillars... 1) Rule of non-regression; 2) Rule of resilience; 3) Rule of 'in dubio pro Natura et Clima'; 4) Rule of sustainable democratic methods; 5) Rule of five responsibilities towards Nature, with reversal of the burden of proof.
>
> *(Executive Summary, p. 7-8)*


- Practical and legal changes are enumerated, including standing, access to justice and legislative hierarchy: 

> First and foremost, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of Nature will grant legal personality to Nature... The contents of the Charter must establish the concept of a natural nested hierarchy of rights... The Charter must promote the objectives of the SDGs and planetary boundaries in law.
>
> *(Section 5.5, p. 69-70)*


- Concrete EU-level lawmaking pathways are proposed: 

> The study recommends two possible legal pathways for the adoption of the Charter... 1) Incorporation into the EU treaties... or 2) Adoption as an inter-institutional non-legislative act by the Council, the Parliament and the Commission.
>
> *(Executive Summary, p. 8; Section 7.1, p. 116-118)*


- Outcomes, governance criteria and indicators are developed via the pillars and associated procedures (e.g., resilience assessments (AoR/RS), non-regression as decision criterion, ‘Amicus Naturae’, Ombudsman, access to justice): 

> It is possible to combine Rights of Nature with the rule of resilience within the legislation on environmental impacts, deepening an appropriate method of implementation... the regulation of a 'resilience study' (RS) and an 'assessment of resilience' (AoR) could become an important link between Rights of Nature, fundamental human rights and environmental assessments.
>
> *(Section 5.6.2, p. 75-77)*

#### ECUADOR09: Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador

- **Organisation**: Republic of Ecuador
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because the Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador explicitly establishes Rights of Nature (Pacha Mama) as binding constitutional law, provides enforceable mechanisms (standing for all persons and communities to defend nature’s rights, obligations for restoration, preventive measures, reversal of burden of proof, and judicial remedies), and integrates these rights across policy, governance, and judicial domains—clear, actionable institutionalization beyond conceptual discussion.

- Context/synthesis: Foundational constitutional recognition and justiciability; nature is a subject of rights and anyone can enforce them: “Nature, or Pacha Mama, where life is reproduced and occurs, has the right to integral respect for its existence and for the maintenance and regeneration of its life cycles, structure, functions and evolutionary processes… All persons, communities, peoples and nations can call upon public authorities to enforce the rights of nature.” (Art. 71)

- Context/synthesis: Concrete mechanisms: right to restoration separate from compensation; preventive measures against extinction/destruction; non-appropriation of environmental services; these are firm legal directives: “Nature has the right to be restored. This restoration shall be apart from the obligation of the State and natural persons or legal entities to compensate individuals and communities… The State shall apply preventive and restrictive measures on activities that might lead to the extinction of species, the destruction of ecosystems and the permanent alteration of natural cycles… Environmental services shall not be subject to appropriation; their production, delivery, use and development shall be regulated by the State.” (Arts. 72–74)

- Context/synthesis: Cross-cutting enforcement in environmental harm, with subsidiary state action, burden of proof shift, and non-prescription of actions: “In case of environmental damages, the State shall act immediately and with a subsidiary approach to guarantee the health and restoration of ecosystems… The burden of proof regarding the absence of potential or real danger shall lie with the operator of the activity or the defendant… The legal proceedings to prosecute and punish those responsible for environmental damages shall not be subject to any statute of limitations.” (Arts. 397, 396)

- Context/synthesis: Representation/participation: constitutional remedies guarantee access, precautionary measures, and effective administrative/judicial action to protect environmental and nature’s rights: “To permit any natural person or legal entity, human community or group, to file legal proceedings and resort to judicial and administrative bodies… including the possibility of requesting precautionary measures that would make it possible to end the threat or the environmental damage…” (Art. 397.1)

- Context/synthesis: Integration through the development structure: the Good Way of Living (sumak kawsay) system and Development Structure embed biodiversity/nature protections in plans, policy, and institutions as criteria for success—goals and indicators become constitutional obligations: “The State shall plan the development of the country to assure the exercise of rights… The good way of living shall require persons, communities, peoples and nationalities to effectively exercise their rights… The development structure shall have the following objectives:… To restore and conserve nature and maintain a healthy and sustainable environment ensuring… equitable, permanent and quality access to water, air and land…” (Arts. 275–276)

#### UNBOL2023: Plurinational State of Bolivia position on Nature-Based Solutions – UNEP Consultation

- **Organisation**: UNEP
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because the text operationalises Rights of Nature for governance (recognition of Mother Earth as a subject of rights) with specific legal and policy steps, embedding them in CBD/COP processes and national policy proposals.

- Context/synthesis: The document grounds its approach in recognising the Rights of Mother Earth—beyond human-centered rights—specifying legal action: 

> On the contrary, the mechanisms and instruments to solve the climate and environmental crisis must recognize the rights of Mother Earth, as a living being with a conscience, as well as the rights of Indigenous Peoples and local communities.
>
> *(p.2)*


- Context/synthesis: The Annex provides explicit legal tasks, showing how to implement nature’s rights within public law and administration: 

> a) Recognize Mother Earth as a living being and subject of rights (Rights of Mother Earth).
>
> *(Annex)*


- Context/synthesis: It seeks institutional change at UNEA (new resolution) and integrates with CBD decisions, linking mechanisms to multilateral frameworks: 

> This proposal has been accepted in the decision 19(f) of the 2022 Kunming Montreal global framework... the consultation must first be satisfactorily concluded by... reformulation of the UNEA Resolution 5/5... in order to consider and integrate plural approaches... such as the ‘Mother Earth Centric Actions’.
>
> *(p.2–3)*

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### SCTRANSS25: Environment strategy for Scotland – transformative changes for sustainability

- **Organisation**: Scottish Government
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because Rights of Nature is central to the legal pathway section and is operationalised with firm, actionable mechanisms (legislation, ecocide, restorative justice, environmental courts, legal guardians, transparency and access-to-justice), showing concrete steps governments can take to empower nonhumans in governance and practice.

- The report makes Rights of Nature a core legal lever and specifies legislative steps, enforcement venues, and public standing to sue to hold harms accountable: 

> Rights of Nature (support global movements on this, explore options for nationally supporting measures on rights of nature – for example, including naturehood to persons, ecocide, plus restorative justice and environmental courts; support community and civic capacity to hold government to account on environmental harms and ensure transparency and accountability mechanisms; observe international legal commitments and treaties on the environment).
>
> *(7.2 Legal and regulatory policy instruments)*


- It explicitly connects RoN to institutional architecture and procedural rights for citizens and civil society, indicating routes for implementation and oversight: 

> Support civil society to create public support for Rights of Nature combined with legislative reforms recognizing rights of citizens and civil society to bring environmental lawsuits, e.g. standing to sue for environmental harms, legal frameworks for environmental rights and strengthening access to justice in environmental matters, including capacity building and legal assistance.
>
> *(Table 3: Legal and regulatory policy instruments – Rights of Nature)*


- The report situates RoN within justice systems, linking it with other concrete legal tools (ecocide, restorative justice, courts) and compliance with international obligations: 

> Create changes in the justice system (e.g. support Rights of Nature through legislative means at national scale, combined with Ecocide, restorative justice and environmental courts. ... Sign up to and observe international treaties on climate and environment, and support progress on Rights of Nature at global scale.
>
> *(Table 3: Legal and regulatory policy instruments)*


- It includes international case examples to demonstrate feasibility, while still focusing on concrete procedural mechanisms Scotland could adopt: 

> Ecuador (2008) was the first country to recognise RoN in its constitution... New Zealand granted legal personhood to the Whanganui River in 2017, recognizing the river as a legal entity with its own rights and interests... In Canada... the Magpie River... [granted] the right to be safe from pollution, and the right to sue.
>

## Score 3: Core Conceptual Device / Implications Explored

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### UNTRANS25: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 1. Transformative change and a sustainable world

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because Rights of Nature is presented as a core legal-ethical avenue within the chapter’s 'equity and justice' principle, explicitly extending justice beyond humans to nonhuman entities and considering implications for transformation, but without detailing institutional mechanisms. - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> For transformative change to address the underlying causes of biodiversity loss and nature’s decline, concepts of equity and justice expand to specifically encompass considerations for other species and natural entities, e.g., through contemporary concepts and approaches such as intergenerational, restorative, multispecies and Earth system justice... as well as through exploring the transformative potential of the rights of nature.
>
> *(Section 1.3.2, Equity and justice)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> The principle of equity and justice relates to the imperative to ensure that interventions for transformative change are fair and allow for the flourishing of all people (both present and future generations) as well as other species and natural entities.
>
> *(Section 1.3.2)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> The links between sustainability and equity have been clearly recognized... However, for transformative change... equity and justice expand to specifically encompass considerations for other species and natural entities...
>
> *(Section 1.3.2)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Adopting these principles as a core part of transformative change actively works to dismantle or decompose the underlying causes of biodiversity loss and nature’s decline, thereby preventing transformative initiatives from being co-opted or diluted...
>
> *(Section 1.3.3)*

#### IPBSVALUES22: Summary for policymakers of the methodological assessment of the diverse values and valuation of nature

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the assessment explicitly discusses rights of nature (including rights of Mother Earth and of specific entities) as rights-based governance instruments to embed diverse (including ecocentric) values into laws and decisions, with implications for policy design and transformative change. - Rights of nature are framed as policy instruments to integrate nature’s values into law: “Different rights-based approaches have been found to incorporate the diverse values of nature into local and national laws and constitutions (e.g., rights to a healthy environment, rights of nature, rights of Mother Earth, rights of specific entities like rivers, lakes, mountains).” (D2) - The assessment shows how such instruments translate into outcomes and legitimacy: “Decision-making... be advanced by following six interrelated values-centred guidelines... Legitimize decisions and their impacts by instilling a sense of co-ownership...” (D1) - It situates rights within broader leverage points for transformative change (policy reform, societal goals): “Working with a combination of four values-based leverage points... reforming policy and shifting societal goals...” (KM9)

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### UNESCOOCEAN24: Ocean decade vision 2030 – Challenge 10

- **Organisation**: UNESCO IOC
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because Rights of Nature is presented as a foundational ethical and political lens for Challenge 10 (‘restore society’s relationship’) with explicit implications across knowledge systems, communications, education, and cultural drivers, and integrated into goals and indicators (e.g., Ocean & Society Survey, GOOS integration), but without detailing legal codification steps. - Context/synthesis: The white paper reframes the challenge to restore society–ocean relations and explicitly centers the ocean as a living entity with its own rights, making RoN a guiding principle. 

> Shifting to an ocean-centred lens, and recognizing the ocean as a living ecosystem, with its own rights, is imperative.
>
> *(p. 8-9)*


- Context/synthesis: The strategic ambition and drivers (knowledge systems, communications, education, cultural connections) work through implications for behavior change, governance, and monitoring. 

> By 2030... shift in the way that ocean science... is formulated, practiced, and communicated... All members of society... have increased motivation, capability, and opportunity to make decisions and behave in ways that ensure a healthy ocean.
>
> *(p. 6)*


- Context/synthesis: It proposes outcomes, datasets, and indicators to embed the rights-centered perspective in practice (e.g., human–ocean values dataset; integrating into GOOS; Ocean & Society Survey), showing operational consequences even if not legal codification. 

> This collective research will directly inform the creation of a human-ocean connection/values data set to be integrated into the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) platform and digital ocean infrastructure.
>
> *(p. 7, 19)*


- Context/synthesis: The paper mandates co-designed theory of change and global networks to institutionalize this lens, linking ethics to implementation pathways. 

> By December 2024 a co-designed theory of change to action the key drivers of Challenge 10... ensuring collaboration, inclusion, and transparency.
>
> *(p. 7-8, 18-19)*

#### STOCK50: Stockholm+50: unlocking a better future

- **Organisation**: SEI & CEEW
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because Rights of Nature is explicitly advanced as a core governance option with analysis of implications (legal, institutional, enforcement) and concrete guidance to consider adoption within national legislative and judicial systems; while it stops short of detailed statutory text, it frames firm proposals for context-specific implementation and alignment with human-rights regimes.

- Context/synthesis: The report presents Rights of Nature as a mechanism to limit extraction and shift behaviors by recognizing nature’s intrinsic value, and it urges national bodies to assess feasibility and requirements for enforcement. 

> Recognize Indigenous local knowledge and the Rights of Nature – National legislative and judicial bodies should consider whether establishing Rights of Nature will help protect nature in specific contexts, based on comprehensive consultation with stakeholders and analysis of what capacities and resources would be needed for effective enforcement.
>
> *(Recommendations – Recognize Indigenous local knowledge and the Rights of Nature)*


- Context/synthesis: It further integrates RoN into human rights by proposing that the Human Right to a clean environment incorporate a personhood rationale, linking ecocentric legal standing with existing rights instruments to drive consequential shifts. 

> The Human Right to clean, safe and sustainable environment should incorporate a Rights of Nature rationale, whereby human responsibility and interests for the protection of Nature as a legal entity with personhood are clearly articulated.
>
> *(Recommendations – Recognize Indigenous local knowledge and the Rights of Nature)*

## Score 2: Theoretical Treatment

### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### UNGEOETHICS22: Concept note of the World Commission on the Ethics of Scientific Knowledge and Technology (COMEST) on the ethics of climate engineering

- **Organisation**: UNESCO COMEST
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the document explicitly raises attributing moral rights to nature (oceans, rivers, ice caps) as a key question, and contemplates international law and governance, but does not yet propose concrete legal personhood or RoN interventions. - It poses the RoN challenge explicitly: 

> Should we also attribute moral rights to nature: to oceans, rivers, ice caps? Whose moral rights should be respected: those of currently living human beings, or also those of future generations?
>
> *(Introduction)*

 - It declares governance and international law analysis as part of its scope: 

> What role does international law have to play in the governance of the technologies, and can they be aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)?
>
> *(Introduction)*

#### EUANTHRO: Exiting the Anthropocene? Exploring fundamental change in our relationship with nature

- **Organisation**: EEA
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the briefing presents Rights of Nature as a policy/legal option (including an EU charter) with discussion of implications and challenges, but not with a concrete implementation blueprint.

- Context/synthesis: The document explores ‘rights of nature’ as a stronger alternative to anthropocentric legal frames: “Some argue for legislation that endows other non-human life forms with rights, and even an EU charter of fundamental rights of nature.” (p.6–7)

- Context/synthesis: It considers feasibility and the need for political value change and enforcement to make RoN meaningful: “Inscribing inviolable rights of nature into law might be a promising strategy... but a mere declaration... is not enough unless it is matched by a concomitant change in political values and practical means of enforcement.” (p.7)

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### IPBESTCA2: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 2. Visions of a sustainable world – for nature and people

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because Rights of Nature is explicitly named as a theme and as specific visions (e.g., Ocean rights), and discussed as part of eco-social imaginaries; however, the chapter provides no detailed, actionable legal designs within this chapter.

- Rights of Nature is a named theme among visions and appears in the inspiring list: 

> These visions address themes such as oceans, land, economy, ecosystems, technologies and rights for nature.
>
> *(Executive Summary)*


- The curated list of inspiring visions explicitly includes rights instruments: 

> Vision names: ... 45) Ocean rights; ...
>
> *(Figure 2.5 list)*


- Rights of Nature is situated in broader institutional imaginaries with references to practice and diffusion: 

> New eco-social imaginaries can inform visioning processes... Diverse ideas include initiatives such as Wilson’s advocacy for half Earth, rights of nature, transformative ways of human and non-human nature relating through intuitive communication...
>
> *(2.4.2)*


- Prevents higher score: no specific jurisprudential mechanisms, institutional arrangements, or implementation steps are detailed in this chapter.

#### EUINVASIVE24: IPBES Invasive Alien Species Assessment: Chapter 1. Introducing Biological Invasions and the IPBES Thematic Assessment of Invasive Alien Species and Their Control

- **Organisation**: Roy
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the chapter discusses extending legal rights to animals and nature as part of the ethical context of IAS decisions, without detailing rights-based governance instruments for IAS control.

- Context/synthesis: The text explicitly raises the idea of extending legal rights to nature, and the potential conflicts this brings to IAS management. “The extension of legal rights to animals and nature imposes moral and legal limits on acceptable human uses of the environment... the interests of individual animals may conflict with interests of individual species, as can be the case with native and invasive alien species.” (Section 1.5.3)

- Context/synthesis: It relates rights-thinking to practice by connecting to debates over humane methods, gene editing, and acceptable harm. “Genome editing can pose ethical questions... Gene suppression-drives may pose risks... There are several reports outlining the risks and opportunities of these technologies... Biological control can pose potential social and environmental risks, but often brings benefits...” (Section 1.5.3)

#### EUHRPLAN21: Human rights for the planet

- **Organisation**: Council of Europe
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because Rights of Nature is explicitly discussed with detail as a comparative and theoretical development (Inter-American context, constitutional examples, and Mother Earth instruments) and its implications are explored in relation to the ECHR, but it is not adopted nor operationalized in the European system; the document raises possibilities and questions rather than implementing mechanisms that empower nonhumans in Europe.

- Comparative discussion of autonomous environmental rights that protect nature for its own sake: 

> the Inter-American Court... stated that a healthy environment was ‘a universal interest’ and ‘a fundamental right for the existence of humankind.’ Taking note of the trend to recognise legal personality of nature... ‘the right to a healthy environment as an autonomous right ... protects the components of the environment, such as forests, rivers and seas, as legal interests in themselves, even in the absence of the certainty or evidence of a risk to individuals ... it protects nature and the environment, not only because of the benefits they provide to humanity ... but because of their importance to the other living organisms with which we share the planet that also merit protection in their own right.’
>
> *(Anthropocentric or ecocentric human rights? – Inter-American approaches)*


- European inquiry into moving beyond anthropocentrism towards ecocentric/biocentric approaches potentially consistent with Rights of Nature logics: 

> is there a room in the European human rights law for a biocentric or immersive anthropocentric vision... Could we go one step farther and take an ecocentric approach according to which nature has a value of its own, that is to say, irrespective of any benefits that it may generate for humans?
>
> *(Overview of ECtHR environmental case-law)*


- Reference to constitutional and legal personhood developments that mirror Rights of Nature: 

> We all know about the attribution of legal personality to exotic rivers and forests, or Mother Nature... Recognition of Ganges and Yamana rivers as juridical persons... recognition of legal personhood of the Atrato River and Amazon Forest... Constitutions of Bolivia and Ecuador that create a new political and legal subject: nature – Pachamama - Mother Earth.

#### EUONEHEALTH24: One Health governance in the European Union

- **Organisation**: SAPEA
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report explicitly discusses Rights of Nature as a legal avenue and presents implications (including litigation and personhood examples), but treats it as emerging and exploratory rather than laying out concrete EU implementation mechanisms.

- The report highlights litigation and rights-based avenues as potential game-changers for environmental and multispecies protection and access to justice: 

> Litigation on the basis of the right to One Health (and specifically a healthy environment) may be a game-changer in the future, offering new opportunities for access to justice and to protect against gaps in existing legislation...
>
> *(EU policies – Summary/Key findings; Legal right to One Health?)*


- It explicitly discusses rights of nature and potential extension of legal rights to non-human entities within European contexts, indicating conceptual implications: 

> There have been efforts to establish legal protections for animals and to advocate for the rights of nature... In certain contexts, such as legal dealings and advocacy initiatives, this language can prove pragmatic and effective.
>
> *(One Health definition – Ethical considerations)*


- It connects to EU-relevant jurisprudence and policy debates, describing consequential shifts if such rights are recognised: 

> ‘Earth’ jurisprudence... may become more important in the EU, if existing One Health legislation and policies do not embed diverse cultural, Indigenous and philosophical perspectives. Elsewhere... extension of legal rights to natural, non-human and even non-sentient entities such as rivers.
>
> *(EU policies – Legal right to One Health?)*


- It provides a notable precedent that shapes negotiation strategies and goals (recognition of nonhuman interests), but does not yet prescribe specific EU codification steps: 

> For example, the Whanganui River in New Zealand was granted legal personhood... obliging both governmental and local guardians to manage the river’s health...
>
> *(EU policies – Legal right to One Health?)*

#### TNBEYOND24: Analysing the beyond growth debate

- **Organisation**: TNO Publiek
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the review discusses Rights of Nature as implemented in Ecuador/Bolivia (and other cases) and examines its practical challenges and implications, but does so analytically rather than as an actionable proposal by the authors.

- The report details constitutional RoN provisions and their scope: 

> Buen vivir was established as the foundational principle of the new constitution... Nature rights thus got embedded in the national constitution.
>
> *(Text box A7)*


- It assesses practice and challenges (neo-extractivism, enforcement), revealing consequences: 

> However, the contribution of these policies to a society organised via buen vivir principles in practice... was limited... oil extraction in Yasuni National Park... decision to extract... ignored proposals...
>
> *(Text box A7)*


- It proposes research questions on implementation fidelity and power dynamics: 

> How could buen vivir be practiced in (central state) policies, while adhering to the... (2008) definitions... How could buen vivir overcome existing dominating power structures...
>
> *(A.7.5)*

#### SIPSECURITY21: Anthropocene (in)securities: reflections on collective survival 50 years after Stockholm

- **Organisation**: SIPRI
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the text engages Rights of Nature in the legal genealogy (e.g., World Charter for Nature) and critiques human-centered doctrines (principle 21), arguing for ecocentric legal evolution; however, it does not prescribe domestic RoN adoption mechanisms within this volume.

- Context/synthesis: It recounts the World Charter for Nature’s rights language and uses it to ground an ecocentric turn in law. 

> In June 1980... a draft World Charter for Nature... In the 1982 World Charter for Nature, the technocratic language of the Stockholm Declaration is replaced with statements recognizing the rights of nature as something with intrinsic value...
>
> *(Chapter 7 – Two genealogies)*


- Context/synthesis: It contrasts RoN with sovereignty-over-resources, underscoring how RoN could replace extractivist legal defaults (principle 21). 

> Principle 21... is a licence for resource extraction... while it could have... imposed strong and binding biodiversity protection obligations... Instead, it institutionalized a wholesale appropriation of non‑human lives and ecosystems as property to the state...
>
> *(Chapter 7 – How principle 21... damaged environmental law)*

### SCENARIOS AND FUTURES EXPLORATION

#### NESTORIES24: Mapping and analysis of alternative growth paradigms: towards a taxonomy and storylines

- **Organisation**: MultiFutures/TNO
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because Rights of Nature are explicitly included as a candidate policy in the designed ‘Great Mindshift’ storyline, though the report remains at the scenario design stage.

- Context/synthesis: Rights of Nature are a characteristic policy within the ecological/Indigenous-oriented storyline: “– Cultural and indigenous rights, rights for nature” (Table 10; 4. Great Mindshift_comb). (p.44)

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### UNCITIES21: Global environment outlook for cities – towards green and just cities (GEO for Cities)

- **Organisation**: UNEP & UN-Habitat
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report mentions Rights of Nature as a salient legal framing with examples (Ecuador, Bolivia, Mexico City), highlighting implications for multispecies governance, but does not present a detailed city-level RoN legal architecture.

- Explicit mention and implications: 

> Examples of pioneers of such a multispecies approach include Ecuador and Bolivia, whose constitutions enshrine the rights of nature, as well as Mexico City, whose constitution respects the rights of companion animals. While these provisions have yet to be fully implemented in practice, they are laudable first steps in a desirable direction.
>
> *(Chapter 4, 4.2.3)*


- Integration within multispecies justice: Rights of Nature is used to exemplify legal routes for nonhuman empowerment within the broader justice framework. (Chapter 4, 4.2.3)

- Outcomes in planning: Encourages biodiversity plans, corridors, and regulatory protections aligned to existence rights. (Chapter 4, 4.2.3)

### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### GOVUK22: What is environmental degradation, what are its causes, and how to respond?

- **Organisation**: IDS (ESRC/FCDO)
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because Rights of Nature is mentioned indirectly in relation to 'Mother Earth', 'pachamama' and indigenous legal framings, but the document does not develop RoN mechanisms; it is cited as an example within the 'care' narrative.

- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Represented most obviously in a wide range of ‘indigenous’ perspectives... Such conceptions of human–nature relations are central to some political movements and the concept of pachamama has become acknowledged in national legislation in Bolivia (Tola 2018).
>
> *(4.4 Narrative 4)*


- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> In global debates – for example around biodiversity through the IPBES... process – non‑Western framings are becoming increasingly heard as part of debates (Borie and Hulme 2015; Tengö et al. 2017).
