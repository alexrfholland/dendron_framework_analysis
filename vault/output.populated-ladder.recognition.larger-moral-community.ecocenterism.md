# Ecocenterism / ecocentric values

## Score 4: Actionable Mechanisms

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### EURIGHTS: Towards an EU Charter of the Fundamental Rights of Nature

- **Organisation**: EESC
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because the document explicitly calls for a shift from anthropocentric to ecocentric worldviews and encodes this shift into legal structures (Charter, nested hierarchy of rights, rules like in dubio pro natura), with concrete steps for EU implementation.

- Ecocentric shift is explicitly required and embedded: 

> This necessary step will involve the legal recognition of the Rights of Nature on all levels and a shift from a purely anthropocentric worldview to a more ecocentric worldview that sees humanity as one species within a radically interconnected web of life.
>
> *(Executive Summary, p. 7)*


- Legal mechanisms to instantiate ecocentrism: 

> By changing the legal status of Nature from an object of law to a subject of law... This brings Nature into our legal, political, social and economic decision‑making as a 'stakeholder'... People would also be empowered to bring cases to defend the Rights of Nature...
>
> *(Section 5.3, p. 62-63)*


- Nested hierarchy of rights operationalizes ecocentric values as decision criteria: 

> This model of nested rights brings a unifying overarching framework to the balancing of interests and weighing of divergent objectives, overcoming the existing fragmentation and imbalance.
>
> *(Section 5.3, p. 65)*


- Legislative and governance outcomes proposed: 

> The Charter must promote the objectives of the SDGs and planetary boundaries in law... making practices that violate Rights of Nature illegal, giving governments a legal imperative to phase out subsidies...
>
> *(Section 5.5, p. 70)*

## Score 3: Core Conceptual Device / Implications Explored

### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### UNESCOEDU20: Learning to become with the world: education for future survival

- **Organisation**: Common Worlds/UNESCO
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Humanities/Ethics

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the authors make ecocentric thinking foundational to their critique of human exceptionalism and to their proposals (cosmopolitics, pluriversal ontologies, more-than-human pedagogy), and they consider practical implications for education, though they do not specify concrete policy mechanisms. - They explicitly reject anthropocentrism and elevate ecocentric values: 

> Now wary of human-centric modes of thinking and acting, we actively resist the premise of human exceptionalism and refuse the perilous proposition of human dominion on Earth.
>
> *(Visionary declarations, 1)*

 - They adopt ecocentric ontologies and animacy of worlds as a basis for justice and education: 

> Through learning and teaching the principles of pluriversality - including the multiplicity of ways of knowing and being, the wisdom of Indigenous ontologies, and the animacy of worlds beyond the human - we have expanded our notion of justice. As a result, the practice of education is now infinitely more inclusive.
>
> *(Visionary declarations, 1)*

 - They argue humans are ecological beings and embed curricula in ecological consciousness, linking ecocentrism to outcomes: 

> We have dissolved the boundaries between the ‘natural’ and ‘social’ sciences, and all curricula and pedagogies are now firmly grounded in an ecological consciousness.
>
> *(Visionary declarations, 2)*

 - The report develops implications across ethical/conceptual (cosmopolitics), empirical/science (rejecting ecosystem ‘servicing’ narratives), and political dimensions (UN re-naming to ‘Naturescultures’): 

> Drawing on the principles of cosmopolitics enabled us to adopt a much broader definition of what it means ‘to belong’ – one that embraces everyone and everything both living and nonliving – and therefore encompasses more-than-human worlds.
>
> *(Visionary declarations, 6)*

#### UNGEOETHICS22: Concept note of the World Commission on the Ethics of Scientific Knowledge and Technology (COMEST) on the ethics of climate engineering

- **Organisation**: UNESCO COMEST
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the note makes the inclusion of ecocentric perspectives a declared aim of its ethical analysis, exploring implications for rights of animals, intrinsic value, and sustainable development interactions, but it does not yet prescribe concrete ecocentric governance mechanisms. - It explicitly calls for ecocentric perspectives: 

> In line with previous UNESCO reports on water ethics and land ethics, the report will stress the importance of including ecocentric perspectives in the analysis of the ethical debate.
>
> *(II. Ethical issues)*

 - It plans to address conflicts across SDGs with ecocentric considerations: 

> While much of the focus has been on the implications for SDG13 (Climate Action), it is important to map impacts against the full range of the SDGs... with negative cascading effects for a range of SDGs... interactions between the different SDGs is another example of the fundamental ethical debates.
>
> *(II. Ethical issues)*

#### COMESTWATER22: Report of COMEST on water ethics: ocean, freshwater and coastal areas

- **Organisation**: UNESCO COMEST
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the report explicitly calls for a shift from anthropocentric to ecocentric ethics, treating ecosystems and nonhumans as morally considerable, and works through implications for policy, governance, and ethical principles, though without a single concrete statute to enforce ecocentrism. 

- Clear shift advocated: 

> This requires a shift from an anthropocentric approach to a more ecocentric approach based in part on principles of equity while recognizing cultural and ecosystem diversity.
>
> *(Executive Summary, 2)*


- Ecocentrism informs solidarity and justice: 

> Solidarity entails… an ecological and ecocentric context, acknowledging the dependence of other biotic communities on water.
>
> *(VI.2 Solidarity)*


- It integrates ecocentrism into common good and governance debates: 

> There is an urgent need to improved mechanisms to enforce the provisions of the law of the sea… Parties shall apply a precautionary approach.
>
> *(II.3 Ocean Governance; VI.3 Common Good)*


- It shapes evaluation criteria and recommended actions: 

> All human beings and life forms across the planet should have access to high quality water services… sustainable management of natural resources and terrestrial and marine ecosystems.
>
> *(VII Recommendations, preface)*

### IMPLEMENTATION AND METRICS

#### D4C25: Design for Environmental Conservation (Toolkit)

- **Organisation**: None
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Design/Engineering

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the work consistently advances an ecocentric, multispecies ethos as foundational to method design (think like nature would; nonhumans as stakeholders), and translates it into implications and tools, though it is not a single legal/policy mandate. 

- Ecocentric premise: “Design for Conservation (D4C) aims to offer an alternative: a participatory, decolonial, multi-species, and distributed methodology… recognizing that solutions… must follow the laws of nature itself.” (Ch.1)

- Operational implications: “Think Like Nature Would… seven mindsets… Honest, Positive, Humble, Systemic, Balanced, Cyclic, Relative… align human creativity with the wisdom of natural systems.” (Ch.4)

- Application in tools: “(Re)Connect… Botanical Empathy… explore your plant-self in your cultural ecosystem… Integrate nature as a stakeholder in facilitation (‘learn from the ocean, not about the ocean’).” (Ch.3, Ch.6)

- Indicators/goals: “Impact measurement is crucial… Sustainability Radar and Checklist… Impact Planning Tool… ensure projects remain sustainable and effective over time.” (Ch.9)

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### UNPLANETBOUND22: Thematic study: planetary boundaries

- **Organisation**: UNDRR
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the study argues for non-anthropocentric ethical care and for recasting humans as part of the Earth system—an ecocentric stance—and explores implications for governance, stewardship, and DRR, though without fully codified legal mechanisms. - It rejects human–nature separation: 

> Systemic risk governance must overcome the false dichotomy between humans and their environment and embrace non-anthropocentric ethical care principles, which prioritise protection of the ‘more-than-human world’ in addition to human well-being.
>
> *(Part 2.2, Goal)*

 - It reframes humans within Earth’s systems: 

> In the Anthropocene biosphere, society must be viewed as part of the biosphere, not separate from it. Humans are not just linked with nature, but ‘intertwined across temporal and spatial scales’.
>
> *(Part 1.3)*

 - It draws policy implications: 

> The novel challenges of Earth system transformation require a fundamental transformation of the systems of global environmental governance... With at least four planetary boundaries now having been transgressed, it is clear that global environmental governance must discard outdated assumptions of Holocene stability.
>
> *(Part 2.3.2, Priority for Action 2)*

#### IPBSVALUES22: Summary for policymakers of the methodological assessment of the diverse values and valuation of nature

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the assessment explicitly names bio/ecocentric world-views in its typology and uses them as a core conceptual lens to evaluate policies, valuation methods, and governance, with implications across ethical, scientific, technical, and political contexts. - Ecocentric world-views are defined and contrasted with anthropocentric perspectives: “World-views... Anthropocentric world-views prioritize people; bio/ecocentric world-views emphasize nature’s inherent value and its evolutionary and ecological processes.” (Box SPM 1) - These world-views structure how values are formed and change, informing decision guidelines and governance instruments: “The values typology can help policymakers identify how different types of values can best be handled in different decision-making contexts.” (A2) - The report traces implications for instruments like rights, accounting, and valuation methods that better reflect ecocentric perspectives: “Valuation processes can be tailored to equitably take into account the values of nature of multiple stakeholders...” (KM4); “Rights-based approaches... such as rights of nature, rights of Mother Earth...” (D2) - The assessment links ecocentric lenses to outcomes/criteria by embedding them within scenario pathways aiming at sustainability-aligned values: “Putting sustainability at the heart of decision-making can be supported by redefining ‘development’ and ‘good quality of life’...” (KM8)

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### UNLANDETHICS: Concept note of the World Commission on the Ethics of Scientific Knowledge and Technology (COMEST) on land-use ethics

- **Organisation**: UNESCO COMEST
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the report explicitly calls for moving away from purely anthropocentric views towards ecocentric ethical perspectives as part of its core framework, and elaborates implications (balancing human development with ecosystem integrity), but leaves ecocentric implementation to general policy recommendations rather than specific institutional mandates. - It calls for ecocentric ethics: 

> This includes appreciation of the interdependency of humankind and the environment, as well as a move away from a purely anthropocentric view to one that encompasses a more ecocentric ethical perspective.
>
> *(I.4. The Importance of Land Use Ethics)*

 - It embeds ecocentrism in guiding principles (solidarity/interdependency, sustainability, prevention of harm, diversity): 

> Solidarity and Interdependency... both humans and other living organisms are dependent on land... Sustainable land use can reduce poverty and hunger, but... land-based ecosystems are also under threat... The ‘Do no harm’ principle must guide land-use ethics.
>
> *(III.2)*

#### NZOCEAN21: The breaking wave: reforming the oceans management system in Aotearoa New Zealand

- **Organisation**: Environmental Defence Society
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because ecocentrism is explicitly introduced, contrasted with anthropocentrism, and used to explore practical implications (e.g., zero tolerance for bycatch, reorientation of tools, representation and personhood), informing outcomes and policy criteria across ethical, scientific, and political domains. 

- Framing and implications: 

> An ecocentric view is not unfamiliar to the existing system – the existing prohibition on hunting marine mammals is not just because some are threatened, but also because it is seen as 'wrong' to do so... What does an ecologically just transition actually involve other than changing the language our laws and regulations use?
>
> *(Chapter 4.8)*


- Shift from service-based to ecocentric ethics with operational consequences: 

> Perhaps we need to see the living world – including the mangroves, mussels and kelp forests that have to choke on our pollution – as having an existence that is about more than just servicing our needs; the fact they are, increasingly, no longer doing so can be seen as nature’s last available form of protest, rather than just a breakdown of a human production line.
>
> *(Chapter 4.3 Ethics and ecosystem services)*


- Criteria and tools aligned to ecocentrism (bycatch, personhood, koha): 

> Would true ecological justice mean that legal frameworks became more normatively consistent, and take a zero-tolerance approach to bycatch – recognising that human respect for nature does not kick in only when species are faced with extinction?
>
> *(Chapter 4.8)*


- Integration with planning/policy: 

> Deeper change might involve things like rethinking our assumptions about consumers, producers and the marine economy, and what 'Capitalism 2.0' or a stronger Māori economy might look like in respect to the oceans.
>
> *(Chapter 1.10 Part 3: Drawing the threads together)*

#### UNBOL2023: Plurinational State of Bolivia position on Nature-Based Solutions – UNEP Consultation

- **Organisation**: UNEP
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because ecocentrism is explicitly adopted as the conceptual foundation for the proposed governance approach and is used to work through its implications (non-commodification, parity of knowledges, redistribution), but many details rely on national follow-up.

- Context/synthesis: The central definition explicitly names an ‘ecocentric (cosmobiocentric) approach’ and connects it to non-commodification and multispecies continuity: 

> an ecocentric (cosmobiocentric) approach and based on rights... promotes the continuity of all living beings and their communities and ensures the non-commodification of the environmental functions of Mother Earth.
>
> *(Annex)*


- Context/synthesis: The text critiques anthropocentrism and capitalism (and their consequences) and develops an alternative value orientation with concrete consequences for international policy design: 

> The concept of Nature-Based Solutions is an eurocentric and anthropocentric concept that promotes planetary environmental neocolonialism and framed within capitalism...
>
> *(p.1–2)*


- Context/synthesis: It articulates the ethical/political program stemming from ecocentrism—plural ontologies, wealth redistribution, epistemological parity—and translates them into proposed policy items in the Annex (bullets a–l).

## Score 2: Theoretical Treatment

### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### UNESCOBIO11: Ethics and biodiversity

- **Organisation**: UNESCO
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report explicitly presents Ecocentrism as a named environmental-ethical approach with description of its principles and implications for biodiversity, but it remains primarily theoretical without concrete, institutionalized mechanisms for governance or practice that would operationalize ecocentrism in a more-than-human decision-making context.

- Context/synthesis: The report defines ecocentrism and positions it as a holistic, anti-reductionist framework recognizing the ecosphere as central, linking it to biodiversity protection but noting practical limits; it offers conceptual guidance rather than specific policy mechanics: 

> Ecocentric approaches, those which ‘take a point of view that recognizes the ecosphere, rather than the biosphere, as central in importance, and attempts to redress the imbalance created by anthropocentrism’. That such a view connotes an opposition to biocentric or anthropocentriv views is an unnecessary limitation on consideration. Ecocentric approaches can be useful in bridging the gap between individual, population and habitat, or concepts of self and environment.
>
> *(2.5 Ecocentrism)*


- Context/synthesis: It explains the holistic and complicating nature of ecocentrism, emphasizing system-level management of biodiversity but acknowledging knowledge/practical risks, which keeps the discussion at the level of theory: 

> The holism of such an ecocentric approach proves to be both a beneficial and complicating factor. The holistic aspects of ecocentrism arise from the anti-reductionist tendencies of incorporating all parts of the system... Ethical choices... are the most complicated due to the myriad of dynamics... The possibility for unforeseen consequences of tampering on a large scale is high... The dangers of such actions have been recognized and recommendations for moratoriums on geo-engineering have been sent for consideration.
>
> *(2.5 Ecocentrism)*


- Context/synthesis: The text contrasts ecocentrism’s desirability with the current pragmatic limits of implementing it, showing the framework is discussed as an approach rather than a binding policy: 

> Ecocentrism on the surface may appear to be the most inherently sensible approach... However, at this time the pragmatics of such an approach is far from ideal, as the level of knowledge necessary... is far from adequate.
>
> *(2.5 Ecocentrism)*

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### EIVIS23: Exploring new visions for a sustainable bioeconomy

- **Organisation**: JRC, EC
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because ecocentrism is explicitly defined and juxtaposed against anthropocentrism to argue for a paradigm shift, but the text does not provide detailed ecocentric institutions or decision rules. - Context/synthesis: The chapter delineates anthropocentrism, biocentrism, ecocentrism, and pluricentrism to frame alternatives. 

> — Ecocentrism: Collectives like ecosystems and biomes also have an intrinsic values in the moral sense of the right to exist. Non-living entities (e.g. waterfalls, stones) may also be deemed to have intrinsic value.
>
> *(Box 1, p. 17)*


- Context/synthesis: It calls for shifting values and mindsets as deep leverage points for policy and governance. 

> This presents a challenge requiring a deeper reframing of bioeconomy strategy based on a fundamental pivot in conceptions of human-nature relationships.
>
> *(p. 15)*


- Context/synthesis: The implications are carried through to monitoring and envisioning, but without ecocentric legal doctrines. 

> Transforming the bioeconomy... will require reflecting on such deep leverage points and deep questions of our existence.
>
> *(p. 10)*

#### IPBESTCA2: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 2. Visions of a sustainable world – for nature and people

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because ecocentric values are explicitly invoked (e.g., need for eco-centric visions), but the chapter treats them as normative guidance and value framings rather than as a fully articulated governance framework with actionable mechanisms.

- The text calls for eco-centric visions to counter reductive or exclusionary approaches: 

> The separation of humans from nature and reductive views that focus only on the biophysical system have been seen as problematic visions... and may need to be countered by more holistic eco-centric visions.
>
> *(Box 2.3, Holistic approaches)*


- The Nature Futures Framework mapping centers value combinations including intrinsic perspectives consistent with ecocentric outlooks: 

> These placements show that it is possible to reconcile these three values of nature and their associated visions in potentially transformative ways.
>
> *(2.3.2.2)*


- Prevents higher score: no detailed eco-centric institutional designs or legal mechanisms are offered.

#### EUSTI50: S&T&I for 2050: science, technology and innovation for ecosystem performance – accelerating sustainability transitions

- **Organisation**: EC DG R&I
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because ecocentric values are presented as core to the 'Immersing & Caring within hybrid collectives' perspective and feature in scenario P3 (e.g., multi‑species justice, intrinsic value of nature), but they are not translated into binding empowerment measures independent of the rights‑based mechanisms scored separately.

- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> This framework is characterised by the prevalence of relational ontologies and epistemologies... As a normative guiding concept, many of the scholars use the notion of 'care'... The notion of 'Multi‑species‑justice' provides a justice theory serving as a guidance... various ethical theories like 'biocentrism', or deep ecology offer frameworks for ethical deliberation around the intrinsic worth and value of nature.
>
> *(2.3 Caring within hybrid collectives)*


- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> In this perspective, the concept of ecosystem services is incidental to the reality that all human life is recognised as fully dependent on ecological integrity and flourishing... The intrinsic value of nature and species represents a central pillar of the legal approach enshrining rights of nature.
>
> *(4.1.4 Rights and Justice with Nature – Scenario P3)*

#### EUECOSERVG2021: Ecosystem services accounting – part III

- **Organisation**: JRC, EC
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report explicitly develops and applies an ecocentric vs anthropocentric value framework in its accounting rationale, recognizing ecocentric–intrinsic and ecocentric–instrumental categories and linking them to ecosystem condition and intra-ecosystem flows, but it ultimately implements accounting via human-centered ES flows and does not provide ecocentric governance mechanisms that empower nonhumans.

- The ecocentric–intrinsic and ecocentric–instrumental categories are defined and positioned relative to the cascade model: 

> The value framework in two dimensions is explained in Keith et al. (2020) as follows. • The ecocentric–intrinsic category represents the ongoing functioning of the ecosystem; it works at the ecological level without reference to humans. • The ecocentric–instrumental category refers to intra- and inter-ecosystem flows supporting the provision of ESs. This category reflects dependencies among ecosystem types, but it does not represent a transaction to the economy and society.
>
> *(Chapter 2.1)*


- The authors explicitly use the ecocentric perspective to argue for keeping ecosystem condition and intra-ecosystem flows in the accounting system: 

> Combining the cascade model with the value two-dimensional space ... can facilitate: • an understanding of how the ecocentric perspective can play a role in the delivery of ESs; • an understanding of how all anthropocentric values (not only instrumental but also intrinsic) should be considered final services for human beings.
>
> *(Chapter 2.1)*


- Ecocentric flows are tracked as intra-ecosystem flows (e.g., soil retention maintaining ecosystem condition), but transactional accounting remains anthropocentric: 

> When soil retention flow takes place in other ecosystem types, it is accounted as an intra-ecosystem flow. ... No monetary value can be attributed to intra-ecosystem flows: their role as ‘fortifiers’ of ecosystem types is intermediate in terms of maintaining the ecosystem condition...
>
> *(Chapter 4.3)*


- The framework informs classification and linking of condition to services but does not introduce ecocentric institutions or rights; thus, it remains conceptual/pragmatic rather than empowering.

#### UNLEGAL: Environmental rule of law: tracking progress and charting future directions

- **Organisation**: UNEP
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report explicitly references an ecocentric approach in landmark jurisprudence and connects ecocentric reasoning to rights of nature, but it is not developed as the central organizing framework of the report nor fully operationalized across policies.

- The Colombian Supreme Court explicitly adopts an ecocentric-anthropic framing: 

> The court also connected rights of future generations to the intrinsic value of nature and the need for an ‘ecocentric-anthropic’ approach ‘which places humans on a par with the environment’.
>
> *(Chapter 4, Box 4.7, quoting Future Generations v. Ministry of the Environment and Others)*


- The narrative distinguishes ethical approaches to rights of nature grounded in ecocentrism: 

> A second approach... is based on ethics. This view starts from the idea that some non-human entities have moral status independent from their benefits to humanity. As such, some argue that they inherently possess fundamental legal rights...
>
> *(Chapter 4, Section 4.3.5)*


- The report considers implications (conceptual) for environmental rule of law of ecocentric recognition: 

> According to this perspective, rights of nature are an instrument to improve the functioning of the legal system... Proponents... believe that... is a requirement for the environmental rule of law, just as it is a requirement to protect human and communal rights-holders.
>
> *(Chapter 4, Section 4.3.5)*

#### EUHRPLAN21: Human rights for the planet

- **Organisation**: Council of Europe
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the ecocentric framing is explicitly developed and contrasted with anthropocentrism, with conceptual and jurisprudential implications discussed in depth; however, it is not adopted or operationalized within European mechanisms to empower nonhumans.

- The conference thematizes anthropocentric vs ecocentric directly: 

> The case law of international tribunals will be the topic of our first panel today, which will discuss the so-called anthropocentric and the ecocentric approaches to human rights. These two approaches should not be seen as conflicting ones, but as mutually reinforcing... The ecocentric approach... is the one centered on the protection of our common home, our environment, our planet.
>
> *(Opening by Judge Sicilianos)*


- The ecocentric turn is posed as a live question for European law: 

> First, is there a room in the European human rights law for a biocentric or immersive anthropocentric vision... Secondly, could we go one step farther and take an ecocentric approach according to which nature has a value of its own, that is to say, irrespective of any benefits that it may generate for humans?
>
> *(Overview of ECtHR environmental case-law)*

#### EUNATURERIGHTS21: Can nature get it right? Rights of Nature in the European context

- **Organisation**: European Parliament
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because ecocentric ideas (ecological integrity, eco-constitutional approaches) are discussed, and the study evaluates their potential adaptation into EU law; however, it does not adopt an ecocentric framework wholesale, instead selecting specific principles to integrate.

- Discussing eco-constitutional state and ecocentric critiques: 

> The Rule of Law for Nature focuses on the well-being of both humans and nature in a symbiotic relationship... environmental reductionism, manifested by compartmentalisation, fragmentation and anthropocentrism.
>
> *(2.2 Rights of Nature in legal philosophy)*


- Translating to actionable principles (though framed as principles rather than an explicit ecocentric worldview): 

> principles concerning environmental or ecological integrity... the general principle of non-regression... It may be fruitful to introduce some new principles of environmental law on the constitutional level in EU law.
>
> *(6. A Summary of Proposals)*

#### TNBEYOND24: Analysing the beyond growth debate

- **Organisation**: TNO Publiek
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the review analyses ecocentrism as a moral foundation in frameworks like Buen Vivir and Doughnut (ecological ceiling), linking to nonhuman flourishing, but does not prescribe an ecocentric policy programme by TNO.

- Ecocentrism is explicit in Buen Vivir analysis: 

> Buen vivir... a biocentric rather than anthropocentric vision... Nature has intrinsic rights and human wellbeing is derived from earth wellbeing.
>
> *(A.7.2)*


- It examines how ecocentrism reframes outcomes and indicators in Doughnut and degrowth strands (ecological limits), and raises questions for practice. (A.4; A.5)

#### IPBESPATHWAYS19: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 5. Realizing a sustainable world for nature and people: transformative strategies, actions and roles for all

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because ecocentric orientations are explicitly referenced (e.g., “ecocentric and pluriversal formations”), but the text primarily frames them as conceptual orientations rather than proposing concrete, ecocentric institutional mechanisms.

- The chapter explicitly contrasts anthropocentric formations with ecocentric ones: the figure and narrative describe moving “From Anthropocentric formations based on forms of control and accumulation... To Ecocentric and pluriversal formations based on autonomy and reciprocity.” (Figure 5.12 caption and associated text in 5.7)

- Cultural narrative shifts are proposed to recognize non-human agency: 

> It makes way for pluriversal imaginaries... and recognize the agency and rights of non-human life to flourish.
>
> *(5.7.2)*

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### UKHYDRO22: Written evidence (LUE0078) to the Land Use in England Committee inquiry

- **Organisation**: UKCEH
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: STEM

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because ecocentrism is articulated as a lens and value orientation informing the decision framework and planning critique (e.g., BNG metric limitations), but is not developed as a standalone policy instrument here.

- The ecocentric lens explicitly centres species and ecosystem processes beyond human-only benefits: 

> Ecocentric... contributes information on the multifaceted behaviour of the ecosystem as a whole, including the responses of species and natural processes across multiple spatial and temporal scales.
>
> *(Q1 Response)*


- The submission criticises human-centric simplifications (metric 3) and advocates ecologically grounded models to represent nonhuman needs: 

> Biodiversity Metric 3 does not adequately represent the biodiversity consequences of land-use changes... developers will complete the Biodiversity Metric spreadsheet... their habitat choices will be influenced by their own goals... It is proposed that the completed... spreadsheet would be submitted to the local authority... many local authorities do not have in-house ecologists...

### SCENARIOS AND FUTURES EXPLORATION

#### NEHALF20: Narratives for the Half Earth and Sharing the Planet scenarios

- **Organisation**: PBL
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because ecocentrism (intrinsic value) is explicitly presented as the philosophical foundation for the HE scenario, shaping goals and criteria, but the report itself does not enact ecocentric legal or institutional reforms. 

- Foundational value claim for HE: “the HE scenario... compatible with protection based on the intrinsic value of nature... This position is called ‘eco-centrism’... All species have a right to continued existence.” (3.2.1)

- Consequences for tools: “By polaris[ing]... intrinsic value of nature... translated into strict ecological criteria... ecosystem representation, species persistence, ecological processes, and resilience.” (6.1.2; 4.1.2)

#### NESTORIES24: Mapping and analysis of alternative growth paradigms: towards a taxonomy and storylines

- **Organisation**: MultiFutures/TNO
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the scenarios explicitly call for a shift to ‘ecocentric views’ in governance and behaviour in the Post Growth and Great Mindshift storylines, though as part of scenario narratives rather than immediate policy.

- Context/synthesis: Post Growth storyline: “Changing current norms, values and behaviours towards more ecocentric views with strong governmental policies is considered a prerequisite...” (Table 10; p.43)

- Context/synthesis: Great Mindshift storyline: “Changing current norms, values and behaviours towards more ecocentric views and a focus on self-sufficiency is considered a prerequisite...” (Table 10; p.43)

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### ISCHEALTH21: Urban health and wellbeing in the Anthropocene: interdisciplinary science-action plan 2021–2025

- **Organisation**: ISC/ISUH/IAP
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report explicitly adopts an ecocentric stance conceptually (calling for a less anthropocentric and more eco-centric view) but does not operationalize ecocentric governance arrangements or decision rights that would directly empower nonhumans. - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: The shift is framed as foundational to the plan’s vision, acknowledging ecosystems as co-constitutive of health, but the mechanisms remain primarily human-institutional: 

> This New Science Plan (2021-2025)... makes a shift from ‘improving health and wellbeing of people in cities’ to ‘improving population and planetary health in the context of complex urban systems’. The fundamental difference lies in the recognition that in an age of the Anthropocene a less anthropocentric and more eco-centric view is essential. It recognizes humans as part of global ecosystems, the health of which guarantees more long-term human health and wellbeing.
>
> *(Summary)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: The report cites scholarship toward an ecocentric rule of law but does not translate it into concrete, ecocentric legal reforms in the plan’s actions:

#### SCTRANSS25: Environment strategy for Scotland – transformative changes for sustainability

- **Organisation**: Scottish Government
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because ecocentric values are foundational to the report’s critique and legal turn (RoN, Earth Jurisprudence), informing the ethical basis for nonhuman empowerment, but the operational mechanisms are articulated under other frameworks (RoN, personhood, convivial conservation).

- The report calls for moving away from anthropocentrism towards ecocentric values underpinning law and policy: 

> Moving away from an understanding of ‘nature’ as external to humans... thinking can extend to recognize the agency, sentience, labours and value of plants, animals and other phenomena...
>
> *(Foreword)*


- Ecocentrism is explicitly linked to the legal frameworks discussed: 

> These are interconnected concepts... shift away from an anthropocentric perspective towards eco-centric ones...
>
> *(7.2 Legal and regulatory policy instruments)*
