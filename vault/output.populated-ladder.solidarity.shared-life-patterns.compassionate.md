### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### EUINVASIVE24: IPBES Invasive Alien Species Assessment: Chapter 1. Introducing Biological Invasions and the IPBES Thematic Assessment of Invasive Alien Species and Their Control

- **Organisation**: Roy
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because compassionate conservation is explicitly discussed as an ethical stance (‘do no harm’, valuing individual animals) influencing debates on appropriate IAS management approaches, but is not operationalized with concrete governance steps in this chapter.

- Context/synthesis: The chapter recognizes compassionate conservation’s maxim and its implications for method choice (e.g., lethal control). “Proponents of compassionate conservation state that humans should do no harm and consider that individual animals matter.” (Section 1.5.3)

- Context/synthesis: It situates compassionate conservation amid practical decision criteria (humaneness, effectiveness, stakeholder preferences). “It is relevant to consider social values and emotional and cultural associations, in addition to stakeholder preferences, humaneness and effectiveness, when managing invasive alien species.” (Section 1.5.3)

### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### ZOO23: Looking at Individual Interests beyond Species Conservation in Zoos.

- **Organisation**: Clay
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Humanities/Ethics

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because compassionate conservation is referenced as part of ‘Zoo Ethics’ debates but not developed or applied directly in the article.

- Context/synthesis: The piece references compassionate conservation as a framework relevant to balancing individual animal interests with conservation. “Zoos must adjust their ethical framework to fully include consideration of these in order to bolster the effectiveness of their institutions as places working to foster care and compassion for the environment (Gray, 2017; Minteer & Collins, 2013).” (Main text)
