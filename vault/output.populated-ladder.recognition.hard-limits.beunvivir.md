## Score 4: Actionable Mechanisms

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### ECUADOR09: Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador

- **Organisation**: Republic of Ecuador
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because Buen Vivir (sumak kawsay) is not merely referenced but is the Constitution’s central development paradigm, translated into binding structures: a dedicated Title (The Good Way of Living System), constitutional objectives, cross-sectoral policies, planning obligations, and explicit goals/criteria (e.g., restoration of nature, equity, water/air/land access), providing actionable mechanisms and indicators for implementation.

- Context/synthesis: Buen Vivir is explicitly named and elevated as the guiding constitutional purpose: “A new form of public coexistence, in diversity and in harmony with nature, to achieve the good way of living, the sumak kawsay.” (Preamble)

- Context/synthesis: Constitutionalization of Buen Vivir in development planning with objectives/indicators—firm policy mechanisms: “The State shall plan the development of the country to assure the exercise of rights, the achievement of the objectives of the development structure… The good way of living shall require… effectively exercise their rights… The development structure shall have the following objectives:… To restore and conserve nature and maintain a healthy and sustainable environment ensuring… access to water, air and land…” (Arts. 275–276)

- Context/synthesis: A dedicated constitutional Title institutionalizes Buen Vivir across systems (education, health, habitat, culture, science, risk, population, safety, transport), anchoring outcomes and governance: “TITLE VII: THE GOOD WAY OF LIVING SYSTEM… The national system of social inclusion and equity is… to ensure the exercise, guarantee, and enforceability of the rights enshrined in the Constitution and the achievement of the objectives of the development plan.” (Art. 340)

- Context/synthesis: ‘Rights of the good way of living’ (water, healthy environment, food, education, health) become enforceable constitutional rights—concrete criteria for success: “The right of the population to live in a healthy and ecologically balanced environment that guarantees sustainability and the good way of living (sumak kawsay), is recognized. Environmental conservation, the protection of ecosystems, biodiversity… are declared matters of public interest.” (Art. 14)

- Context/synthesis: Cross-cutting integration obligates institutions to align budgets, policies, and institutions to Buen Vivir outcomes: “The National Development Plan is the instrument to which public policies, programs and projects, the programming and execution of the State budget… shall adhere.” (Art. 280)

#### UNBOL2023: Plurinational State of Bolivia position on Nature-Based Solutions – UNEP Consultation

- **Organisation**: UNEP
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because Living Well/Buen Vivir is adopted as a concrete governance program with actionable instruments (education, policy integration, redistribution, non-market climate approaches) designed for implementation.

- Context/synthesis: The submission equates its approach with ‘Living Well in harmony and balance with Mother Earth’ and prescribes its integration into policy, programs, and education: 

> c) Integrate the wisdom and cosmobiocentric worldviews of Indigenous Peoples of Living Well in harmony and balance with Mother Earth in policies, programs and projects of the countries.
>
> *(Annex)*


- Context/synthesis: It specifies redistribution (criterion e) and pedagogical change (criterion f), reflecting governance instruments consistent with Buen Vivir: 

> e) Promote economic growth along with wealth redistribution mechanisms, avoiding economic accumulation and inequities among individuals.
>
> *(Annex)*


- Context/synthesis: It defines climate action architecture (non-market, equity, CBDR) consistent with Buen Vivir worldviews: 

> j) Implement joint mitigation and adaptation actions... contemplating equity, common but differentiated responsibilities and non-market approaches to face the climate and environmental crisis.
>
> *(Annex)*

## Score 3: Core Conceptual Device / Implications Explored

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### TNBEYOND24: Analysing the beyond growth debate

- **Organisation**: TNO Publiek
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because Buen Vivir is analysed as a core more-than-human framework (biocentric, community-centric) with explicit implications for policy (rights of nature, customary governance, redistribution), including a policy impact chain, while recognising translation challenges.

- The review defines Buen Vivir’s biocentric ethics and pluriversal governance: 

> Buen vivir is a concept that is a radical alternative to western development thinking altogether... a biocentric rather than anthropocentric vision... recognition of the significance of community... a call for plurinationality... and interculturality...
>
> *(A.7.2)*


- It provides a policy impact chain identifying state, market, and community roles, with outcomes and impacts tied to nonhuman flourishing: 

> Table A.7: Policy impact chain of buen vivir... Community-based property and solidarity-based economy... a life-sustaining and life-nurturing economy without growth... with human beings as central to economy and not capital.
>
> *(A.7.4)*


- It explores legal mechanisms (rights of nature) and risks of co-option (neo-extractivism), demonstrating implications and consequences: 

> Buen Vivir is seen... in particular in Ecuador and Bolivia... inclusion of rights of nature... However, the execution of the state policies in practice did not align... neo-extractivism appears to be another form of capitalist logic.
>
> *(Text box A7)*


- It articulates open implementation questions relevant to governance and practice: 

> How could buen vivir be practiced in (central state) policies, while adhering to the... definitions... How could buen vivir overcome existing dominating power structures...
>
> *(A.7.5)*

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### SCTRANSS25: Environment strategy for Scotland – transformative changes for sustainability

- **Organisation**: Scottish Government
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because Buen Vivir (and Ubuntu) are used as core alternative economic imaginaries informing more-than-human ethics (care, reciprocity, biocentrism), with explicit implications for policy (rights of nature, convivial conservation, customary land rights), though not all are fully codified for Scotland here.

- Buen Vivir and Ubuntu are presented as pluriversal foundations for post-growth, centring nonhuman agency and relational care: 

> Alternative economic models already exist... Buen Vivir in Bolivia and Ecuador, Ecological Civilization in China, degrowth models... Ubuntu, an African philosophy, emphasises interconnectedness... and hence could form an important option for future conservation activities.
>
> *(7.1 Economic and financial policy instruments)*


- The report links these frameworks to concrete policy directions (rights of nature, convivial conservation, decolonising aid, reparations) to empower nonhumans and communities: 

> Invest in and expand Indigenous and local peoples’ customary land rights... support convivial conservation and post-development approaches, efforts to decolonise... environmental funding to address reparations and focus on conviviality.
>
> *(Table 3: Rights-based and customary instruments)*


- It explores implications for conservation and governance through convivial conservation and biocultural regions, addressing outcomes and criteria such as autonomy and solidarity: 

> Convivial conservation promotes public and community solutions instead of market-based ones... strategies include historic reparations... a conservation basic income... redirecting integrated conservation landscapes to degrowth and wealth sharing.
>
> *(7.3 Social and cultural policy instruments)*


- It discusses challenges and risks (e.g., co-option, neo-extractivism) when translating these frameworks into state policy, acknowledging consequences: 

> These developments have opened space... but despite new institutions and plans, these have not successfully challenged the political economy... which is trapped into logics of extracting.
>
> *(Box 6; references section; 7.3)*

## Score 2: Theoretical Treatment

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### EIVIS23: Exploring new visions for a sustainable bioeconomy

- **Organisation**: JRC, EC
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because Buen Vivir is explicitly presented as an Indigenous, pluriversal framework for human–nature harmony to challenge anthropocentrism, but the source does not develop detailed mechanisms for its institutional adoption in EU bioeconomy governance. - Context/synthesis: Buen Vivir is introduced as a core example of non-anthropocentric visions informing policy debates. 

> This is, for instance, captured in the philosophy of “Buen Vivir”, an indigenous Andean philosophy that emphasizes community well-being, reciprocity, solidarity, and harmony with Pachamama (Mother Earth). And the concept of Buen Vivir actually features as a key right in the constitution of several countries, like Ecuador.
>
> *(Chapter 3, p. 17)*


- Context/synthesis: It is used to exemplify relational ontologies considered necessary for a pivot in bioeconomy strategies. 

> Developing our human-nature relationship away from an anthropocentric perspective is an essential leverage point to achieve genuine sustainability, a fact increasingly also recognized by major science-policy initiatives.
>
> *(p. 15)*


- Context/synthesis: While the report weaves these into envisioning and monitoring guidance, it stops short of EU policy design for Buen Vivir. 

> This report might be a new starting point for another “envisioning” cycle, exploring what a bioeconomy strategy based on radically different human-nature relationships could look like.
>
> *(p. 22)*

#### IPBESTCA2: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 2. Visions of a sustainable world – for nature and people

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because Buen Vivir (and related good life/Ubuntu framings) are explicitly included as vision anchors and value framings combining relational and intrinsic values; however, the chapter treats them conceptually and illustratively rather than detailing operational governance mechanisms.

- Buen Vivir is named as an inspiring vision and located in the relational–intrinsic value space with implications for pathways: 

> Vision names: ... 16) Buen Vivir; ...

 and 

> These visions connect to notions like Buen Vivir, Tao and economic framings like degrowth.
>
> *(Figure 2.5 list; Table 2.2 description)*


- The Indigenous section underscores holistic, kinship and oneness perspectives resonant with Buen Vivir: 

> Many Indigenous Peoples and local communities conceive people as part of nature rather than people having dominion over nature. Such conceptions imply a lesser focus on control and determinism... Conceptions of interconnection and oneness span beyond nature and people to include also the physical, spiritual and intellectual aspects of life.
>
> *(Executive Summary point 5; 2.3.4)*


- Prevents higher score: while values and visions are mapped, the chapter does not specify decision-making institutions or legal mechanisms for Buen Vivir in practice.

#### UNPLANETBOUND22: Thematic study: planetary boundaries

- **Organisation**: UNDRR
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report explicitly references ‘well-being economics’ and ‘biosphere economics’ as alternative growth metrics and links them to governance reform, but does not present a full policy package for these economies. - It calls for alternative metrics of growth: 

> Governance that is fit for the Anthropocene should promote different metrics of growth, such as ‘well-being economics’ and ‘biosphere economics’ where biosphere resilience and human well-being are placed front and centre.
>
> *(Part 2.3.2, Priority for Action 2, bullets)*

 - It embeds these metrics in DRR coherence: 

> Risk and resilience can serve as useful framing concepts... By putting resilience at the core of planning... actors can pursue solutions that contribute to all three global agendas.
>
> *(Part 1.4)*

#### IPBESPATHWAYS19: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 5. Realizing a sustainable world for nature and people: transformative strategies, actions and roles for all

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because buen vivir/Sumak kawsay is explicitly invoked as a guiding vision and cultural framework for living well in harmony with nature and spatial planning, but the chapter does not provide detailed, stepwise policy mechanisms to implement buen vivir.

- Buen vivir is invoked as a place-based governing vision: 

> Collaborative initiatives such as these are reflected in the vision of buen vivir – a relational and adaptive way of living in harmony with nature (Chaves et al., 2018).
>
> *(5.3.5)*


- It is also included within paradigms under Wellbeing within Planetary Boundaries: 

> Wellbeing within Planetary Boundaries (including proposals for an economy of the common good, doughnut economy and buen vivir) (Annex 5.4).
>
> *(5.5)*

### SCENARIOS AND FUTURES EXPLORATION

#### NESTORIES24: Mapping and analysis of alternative growth paradigms: towards a taxonomy and storylines

- **Organisation**: MultiFutures/TNO
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because Buen Vivir and Ubuntu are incorporated into the taxonomy and the ‘Great Mindshift’ storyline (rights for nature; Indigenous rights), indicating a more-than-human orientation, albeit at the narrative design stage.

- Context/synthesis: The mapping explicitly includes Buen Vivir and Ubuntu as paradigms and merges them into the storylines: “Buen Vivir/ Sumak Kawsay... Ubuntu economy... Transition theory/Great Mindshift.” (pp.38–41)

- Context/synthesis: The Great Mindshift storyline lists “Cultural and indigenous rights, rights for nature” as characterising policies, reflecting Buen Vivir/Ubuntu influences. (Table 10; p.44–46)

## Score 1: Token Acknowledgement

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### IPBESTCA4: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 4. Overcoming the challenges of achieving transformative change

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because elements such as Sumak Kawsay (Buen Vivir) and Ubuntu are presented in a figure as examples of diverse worldviews in relation to people–nature relations, but the chapter does not elaborate these as economic frameworks or propose their implementation. - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Examples of diverse world views  representing relations between  people and nature  (IPBES 2022 Values Assessment)

 [Figure 4.3 includes items such as SUMAK KAWSAY and UBUNTU among others.] (Figure 4.3) - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> This world view does not erase alternative world views, but it renders them illegitimate or unimportant in the context of addressing biodiversity.
>
> *(Figure 4.3 legend)*
