## Score 4: Actionable Mechanisms

### IMPLEMENTATION AND METRICS

#### NPOS25: Draft State of Nature Metrics

- **Organisation**: Nature Positive Initiative
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Applied/Practice-Based

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because the report operationalizes the Nature-positive framework with a full suite of actionable mechanisms: a universal indicator set, specific metrics and granularity levels, case-specific triggers, a piloting roadmap, and concrete plans to embed the metrics into major standards (TNFD, GRI, SBTN, WBCSD), thereby enabling implementation in governance and practice.

- Context/synthesis: The document positions State of Nature (SoN) metrics as the practical backbone for delivering nature-positive outcomes, detailing indicators (extent, condition, species), metrics descriptions, trigger criteria, and scale-specific granularity to guide action and accountability. 

> State of nature metrics assess the condition and extent of ecosystems, and species population size and extinction risk, including positive or negative changes... Therefore, we seek to identify a small set of metrics that can act as an indication of nature’s overall health.
>
> *(Why state of nature metrics?)*


- Context/synthesis: It sets out a high-level implementation process with four core building blocks (Indicators, Metrics, Granularity level, Triggers) and defines clear measurement specifications and classification systems (e.g., GET Level 3, ≤30m resolution), showing how organizations can operationalize nature-positive monitoring. 

> High-level framework implementation process... 1. Indicators... 2. Metrics... 3. Granularity level... 4. Case-specific metric triggers... [Example] Ecosystem Extent... Classification... GET Level 3... Spatial resolution at ≤30m...
>
> *(Metrics framework components)*


- Context/synthesis: It establishes concrete case-specific trigger criteria for ecosystems and species (e.g., CR/EN, KBAs/HCVs, rapid declines, locally important species/ecosystems) that mandate higher-granularity measurement, providing enforceable pathways for prioritization coherent with a nature-positive strategy. 

> A case-specific metric is triggered when one or more of the underlying criteria apply... Highly threatened species (CR/EN)... Key Biodiversity Area or High Conservation Value criteria... Common species showing rapid declines... Locally important species...
>
> *(Appendix A: Key updates)*


- Context/synthesis: The plan includes piloting (with timeline, recruitment of pilot organizations, communities of practice), iterative guidance, and explicit embedding of SoN metrics into regulatory and voluntary frameworks (TNFD, GRI, SBTN, WBCSD), demonstrating feasible institutionalization. 

> Piloting in 2025 will test applicability... using state of nature metrics in the TNFD’s LEAP Assessment... in alignment with GRI 101: Biodiversity... fold straight into the measurement architecture... integrated into WBCSD’s Nature Metrics Portal...
>
> *(Embedding in frameworks and standards)*


- Context/synthesis: It defines a pressure-state-response architecture whereby SoN metrics complement existing pressure/response metrics to verify whether actions are delivering recovery, thus setting outcome-focused criteria for success aligned with nature-positive. 

> Measuring the state of nature is vitally important because it tells us whether our pressure and response actions are having the desired effect, i.e. are our nature strategies resulting in improved outcomes for nature?
>
> *(Pressure-state-response)*


- Context/synthesis: The document aligns the indicator set with the Kunming–Montreal GBF (Targets 1–4, 11; Headline Indicators A.1–A.3, B.1), linking the nature-positive measurement system with global policy goals and indicators of success. 

> The state of metrics are intended to support action to implement the Global Biodiversity Framework... Some state of nature metrics also align with specific 2030 targets and monitoring indicators within the GBF.
>
> *(Appendix B: Aligning with the GBF)*

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### IMFNAT: Embedded in nature: nature-related economic and financial risks and policy considerations

- **Organisation**: IMF
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because the note explicitly calls for a transition to a nature‑positive economy and provides concrete, actionable mechanisms: e.g., phasing out harmful subsidies (GBF Target 18) with quantified targets ($500bn/yr), protecting 30% land/sea (Target 3), supervisory expectations, disclosures (TNFD/ISSB), taxonomies including nature criteria, scenario analysis, and risk management approaches for banks and insurers.

- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> The need to phase out harmful economic activities and for large investments to transition to a nature‑positive economy underscore s the critical role of financial sector policy instruments.
>
> *(Policy Considerations)*

### SCENARIOS AND FUTURES EXPLORATION

#### PBLNATUREPOS22: Exploring nature-positive pathways: contribution to CBD Post-2020 GBF

- **Organisation**: PBL Netherlands EA
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because 'nature-positive' is the core guiding framework of the report, defined with timelines (2030 net positive, 2050 recovery), applied across sectors (rural landscapes, supply chains, cities), and accompanied by detailed, actionable governance mechanisms, instruments, and institutional pathways for implementation.

- Firm definition with targets and timelines anchoring outcomes and indicators: “A nature-positive approach means reversing nature loss to enable a net positive improvement by 2030… and full recovery by 2050 (requiring large-scale restoration of nature).” (p. 16)

- Policy architectures and enablers for implementation (systemic, structural, enabling levels), including national and international instruments, accountability, and alignment with GBF: “National governments can support… by acting on three fundamental levels: systemic, structural and enabling… aligning with international, national and sub-national goals… accountability mechanisms that provide insight into the contributions by non-state actors and sub-national government… strengthened further.” (p. 27–28, 12)

- Concrete sectoral mechanisms in rural landscapes (integrated landscape approaches; land-use planning; tenure security), supply chains (conservation hierarchy; deforestation-free; regulatory and financial tools), cities (regulatory, financial, and ‘soft’ mechanisms; urban regime shifts): “Landscape approaches… inclusive land-use planning, secure land tenure and define environmental regulations…” (p. 21–22) “There is large potential for business and finance… guided by the conservation hierarchy… an effective international approach requires a combination of measures… establishing deforestation-free supply chains.” (p. 22–24) “Policymakers… a range of regulatory, financial and ‘soft’ governing mechanisms… requirements for achieving multifunctional benefits could… be accompanied by financial rewards.” (p. 26)

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### ICNATUREPOS24: Blueprint for a Nature-Positive Adelaide

- **Organisation**: Interdisciplinary Conservation Science Group
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because the report makes Nature-Positive the central organizing policy framework for Adelaide, defines baselines, targets, indicators, and monitoring, and lays out concrete, sequenced initiatives, funding mechanisms, and institutional roles to implement it city-wide, thereby operationalizing nonhuman-benefiting outcomes.

- The report frames the whole blueprint around becoming a Nature-Positive city, providing a definition with measurable elements and then builds the rest of the report toward that implementation: 

> This report offers an approach for Adelaide to better protect and enhance biodiversity and potentially realise a metropolitan-wide goal of becoming nature-positive, delivering significant enhancements to urban biodiversity, and multiple co-benefits to people living within urban areas.

 It then states: 

> Nature-positive... Key elements include (Milner-Gulland 2022): • A measured biodiversity baseline. • A timeframe. • A target (for example, biodiversity 20% above baseline). • A clear set of actions to be carried out, costed and sequenced. • An analysis of how the actions will add up to get to net gain. • Regular monitoring and disclosure of progress towards the goal.
>
> *(Executive Summary; Key concepts and definitions)*


- The blueprint links the concept to practical initiatives and institutional assignments, explicitly sequencing actions and stakeholders: 

> Building on this foundation, this report recommends a set of specific intervention points to enhance, protect and create new biodiverse green space in Adelaide and achieve the goal of becoming nature-positive.

 It lists six headline initiatives including targets, Caring for Country, a retrofit program, BSUD implementation, capacity (Chief Nature Officer), and strengthened protections. (Executive Summary)

- It details how to embed nature-positive in policy and practice, with governance, monitoring and financing: 

> To become Australia’s first nature-positive city, a combination of initiatives will be required, including enhancements to existing policy, introduction of new guidelines and regulation, and deep engagement with key stakeholders.

 and provides specific steps under Headline initiative 1 (targets, mapping, prioritization), 3 (BSUD program), 4 (regulation for on-site biodiversity gains), and 5 (capacity and finance). (Section 9.2 Headline Initiatives)

- The report develops indicators and monitoring needs as part of the nature-positive approach: 

> There are opportunities to measure progress for biodiversity conservation in Adelaide, including the goal of becoming nature-positive, through either outcome or process-based targets... Currently, tree canopy cover is the only widely adopted biodiversity related target... Resolving gaps will require an iterative conversation regarding what we want to measure, what is possible, and what is cost effective to measure.
>
> *(Section 7.3 Setting targets and measuring success)*


- It provides multiple concrete funding mechanisms to realize nature-positive actions across agencies and the private realm: 

> This section highlights some of the funding approaches... and outlines other innovative financing mechanisms that could be implemented.

 It then sets out tree bonds, specialized grants, crowdfunding, philanthropy, direct stakeholder contributions, PPPs, tax increment financing, and improvement districts. (Section 8.2 Potential funding mechanisms)

## Score 3: Core Conceptual Device / Implications Explored

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### UNCITIES21: Global environment outlook for cities – towards green and just cities (GEO for Cities)

- **Organisation**: UNEP & UN-Habitat
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the report consistently uses 'nature-positive' as a guiding framework for its vision and explores its implications for policy and practice (e.g., halving consumption footprints, restoring habitats, nature-based solutions), but it does not provide one single detailed policy instrument; rather it assembles multiple actionable routes and case applications.

- Foundational framing and implications: 

> This latter entails both human and more-than-human rights to the city (Shingne 2020), as well as what has been termed a nature-positive approach that promotes a 'new relationship between people and nature' to protect and restore natural habitats, promote a better built environment, safeguard the diversity of life, and halve the footprint of production and consumption.
>
> *(Chapter 4, 4.2, emphasis added)*


- Application to outcomes/indicators: The report links nature-positive to urban targets for restoration and footprint reduction across sectors: 

> A nature-positive approach... promotes a 'new relationship' ... to protect and restore natural habitats... and halve the footprint of production and consumption (UNEP 2020a; WWF 2020).
>
> *(Chapter 4, 4.2)*


- Policy/practice pathways: The renaturing pathway operationalizes nature-positive through nature-based solutions and equity safeguards: 

> Under the wide umbrella of 'urban greening', 'biophilic cities' and the 'renaturing' of cities, there is a growing call for collective action to protect biodiversity... Responses include... nature-based solutions... while planning for gentrification effects before displacement happens (e.g., 'just green enough' approaches).
>
> *(Chapter 5, 5.5.1)*

#### EUCLIM24: Towards sustainable transformation: research priorities in climate change and biodiversity

- **Organisation**: EC
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the report uses ‘nature-positive safeguards’ as a policy design implication within a joint governance approach (UNFCCC–CBD alignment) and links it to finance allocation, showing conceptual application and consequences but not full operational detail. - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> The 10 New Insights in 2023 highlighted the need for ‘joint governance’... specifically by increasing alignment between the UNFCCC and CBD, and introducing ‘nature-positive safeguards’ to inform the allocation of climate finance.
>
> *(Section 1.2)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> This underscores the importance of incorporating biodiversity impacts into the design of climate solutions, policies, and strategies.
>
> *(Section 1.2)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Key Research Gaps: What finance mechanisms are needed on national and global levels to achieve both climate and biodiversity goals and how could they be implemented?... Designing carbon offset mechanisms for climate objectives to also encompass biodiversity goals.
>
> *(Section 3.2)*

## Score 2: Theoretical Treatment

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### UNPLANETBOUND22: Thematic study: planetary boundaries

- **Organisation**: UNDRR
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the study repeatedly advocates a “nature-positive and carbon neutral development pathway,” linking it to finance and policy transformation, but it does not provide a detailed, standalone nature-positive policy mechanism. - It identifies nature-positive development as necessary: 

> Transforming economic systems is essential to address the triple planetary crisis. An economic system governed only by metrics of GDP and growth rates is not compatible with a risk-informed sustainable, nature-positive and carbon neutral development pathway.
>
> *(Part 2.2, Goal; see also Part 1.3)*

 - It ties nature-positive to investment criteria: 

> Governments ensure that post-COVID recovery investments double the share of investment on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, nature protection and disaster risk reduction and resilience building.
>
> *(Part 2.3.2, Priority for Action 3, Message 3.1)*

#### IPBESPATHWAYS19: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 5. Realizing a sustainable world for nature and people: transformative strategies, actions and roles for all

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because ‘nature-positive’ language is explicitly tied to financial sector reform and instruments (e.g., loans, taxonomies, disclosures), but while concrete instruments are mentioned, the term is used descriptively rather than as a fully specified governance framework.

- The chapter proposes aligning finance flows and tools to be nature-positive: 

> Biodiversity objectives can be better achieved when aligning private and public financial flows... Numerous initiatives... to reshape finance for nature including... ensuring that loans and other financial tools are nature-positive.
>
> *(5.5.3)*


- It references standards (TNFD, EU taxonomy) and disclosure mechanisms as pathways (5.5.3–5.5.4), anchoring ‘nature-positive’ outcomes to technical instruments.

#### EUHORIZON23: Horizon Europe strategic plan 2025–2027 analysis

- **Organisation**: European Commission
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because 

> nature-positive

 is employed as an explicit strategic aim (e.g., nature-positive economy) across biodiversity and restoration sections, shaping desired outcomes and research directions, but without detailed, actionable policy mechanisms that institutionalise nature-positive accounting or enforceability.

- The futures and gap analyses use nature-positive as an organising goal for economic transformation: under transformative change, potential gaps include developing 

> a nature-positive economy

 and quantifying benefits and costs of action vs inaction, indicating criteria for success: 

> Potential gaps regarding transformative change in which biodiversity is mainstreamed in society and the economy include... 'a nature-positive economy'.
>
> *(Cluster 6 – Biodiversity and natural resources gap analysis)*


- The biodiversity sections call for mainstreaming and nature-based solutions that underpin a nature-positive ambition: 

> A holistic multisectoral and multidimensional approach is needed... paying particular attention to interlinkages between biodiversity and climate... Nature-based solutions should be scaled up, including through new business models.
>
> *(Section 3.2.2)*


- The document repeatedly positions restoration laws, protected areas, and ecosystem services as pathways toward nature-positive states, but does not specify enforceable nature-positive targets or accounting frameworks; hence, conceptual rather than actionable.

#### IUCNBUILD25: Catalysing biodiversity on buildings: a review of supporting initiatives in European cities

- **Organisation**: IUCN
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Design/Engineering

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because ‘nature-positive’ is mentioned in passing to characterize outcomes, but not developed as a structured policy framework with mechanisms in this report. - “Leading cities are already witnessing nature-positive change, driven partly through an array of innovative regulations, incentives, and technical guidance...” (1.1)
