# Half Earth

## Score 4: Actionable Mechanisms

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### LANCETFOOD19: Food in the Anthropocene: the EAT–Lancet Commission on healthy diets from sustainable food systems

- **Organisation**: Lancet
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because the Commission explicitly proposes adopting a 'Half Earth' strategy as an actionable policy to safeguard biodiversity and food-system resilience, with concrete mechanisms (area targets, biome integrity metrics, protected areas, land-sparing), integrating it into a broader governance and implementation roadmap.

- Clear proposal as part of governance strategy: “Strong and coordinated governance of land and oceans… adopting a Half Earth strategy for biodiversity conservation to safeguard resilience and productivity in food production.” (Executive summary)

- Detailed operational framing and indicators: “Proposals suggest that we can halt biodiversity loss and conserve at least 80% of preindustrial species richness by protecting the remaining 50% of Earth as intact ecosystems… Translating to (globally) zero future land conversion of natural ecosystems into farmland (ie, to implement a Half Earth strategy)… complies with the biome or regional boundary… of maintaining a biodiversity intactness index of 90%.” (Land-system change)

- Linked implementation mechanisms and negotiation: “Staying within the biodiversity boundary… depends on fine-scale conservation efforts within agricultural landscapes… integrating a minimum of 10% of ecologically conserved land at fine scales (<1 km²) into agricultural systems enables habitat connectivity… establishment of new protected areas, expansion and increased enforcement in key biodiversity areas, increasing international trade from high yielding nations with low biodiversity…” (Section 3)

- Embedded in a multi-pronged roadmap with goals/criteria: “We provide five specific and implementable strategies… Strong and coordinated governance of land and oceans… management policies aimed at restoring and re-foresting degraded land, establishing mechanisms of international land-use governance…” (Section 4)

### SCENARIOS AND FUTURES EXPLORATION

#### NEHALF20: Narratives for the Half Earth and Sharing the Planet scenarios

- **Organisation**: PBL
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because the report develops Half Earth as a core scenario and provides concrete, actionable mechanisms and governance proposals: a 50% protection target operationalized via ecoregion categorization and spatial priorities, complementary agricultural and policy instruments (zoning, incentives, standards), and alignment with the Global Deal for Nature, laying out steps, stakeholders, and instruments to implement the framework in practice. 

- Core scenario with explicit target and operational logic: “the HE scenario... directly stems from the proposals of E.O Wilson to protect half of the earth... the HE scenario was envisioned to be compatible with protection based on the intrinsic value of nature... conservation strategies are mostly directed to separate nature and wilderness from human pressures by protecting half of the earth.” (Main findings; 2.1)

- Concrete spatial mechanism via ecoregion categories and priorities: “the HE target for 2050 is to protect 50% of each eco-region... Dinerstein et al. (2019) divided the 800+ ecoregions into 4 categories... Half Protected... Nature Could Reach Half... Nature Could Recover... Nature Imperilled... These conservation priorities help nuancing the idea of protecting half of the earth.” (4.1.2)

- Policy and governance instruments to deliver: “Phalan et al. (2016) identify ‘four categories of ‘active’ land sparing mechanisms... land-use zoning; economic incentives, strategic deployment of technology, infrastructure and knowledge; standards and certification.” (4.2.3)

- Integration with Global Deal for Nature as a policy vehicle: “Dinerstein et al. (2019) proposed a ‘Global Deal for Nature’ that is a policy framework that should work along with the Paris Agreement... objectives: (1) protecting biodiversity, (2) mitigating climate change and (3) reducing threats to ecosystem intactness.” (4.3)

- Coupling with agricultural transition and standards: “the agricultural system... dominated by a land sparing approach and sustainable intensification... technological development... within environmental standards worldwide.” (2.1; 4.2.1–4.2.4)

## Score 3: Core Conceptual Device / Implications Explored

### SCENARIOS AND FUTURES EXPLORATION

#### PBLNATUREPOS22: Exploring nature-positive pathways: contribution to CBD Post-2020 GBF

- **Organisation**: PBL Netherlands EA
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the 'Half Earth' scenario is a central analytical pathway used conceptually and quantitatively to explore implications for biodiversity, climate, and food security; it is not proposed as a binding policy but as a core scenario to test trade-offs and pathways.

- Core use of Half Earth as a scenario to explore alternative pathways and trade-offs: “we used two recently developed conservation and agriculture scenarios — Half Earth and Sharing the Planet — to elaborate on what efforts are required to achieve nature-positive goals.” (p. 14)

- Consideration of implications and consequences (trade-offs, need for complementary policies) developed via model-based analysis: “ambitious conservation efforts alone will not be enough… might even increase trade-offs… complementary sustainability measures had to be combined… dietary changes… climate mitigation…” (p. 19)

- Operationalized with indicators (e.g., Mean Species Abundance) and concrete time horizons to inform governance and future practice: figure and text show scenario trajectories (Figure MF.1, p. 15) and “quantitative analysis of solution-oriented scenarios shows…” (p. 17–19)

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### TWITRANS18: Transformations to achieve the sustainable development goals

- **Organisation**: IIASA (TWI2050)
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the report explicitly references and engages with the Half-Earth proposal as a guiding conservation destination in its land-use transformation section, considers its implications (land-sparing, diet shifts, yield increases, protected area expansion), and uses it to develop goals and pathways; however, it does not present a concrete, detailed institutionalization plan to implement Half-Earth in governance (so not a 4).

- The Half-Earth concept is presented as a scientific destination to safeguard Earth system functions, and the report explores its implications for feeding humanity on existing farmland (conceptual application): 

> To preserve biodiversity and ecosystem functions, some parts of the planet must become protected areas; the biologist E. O. Wilson has called for protecting ‘half Earth’ (Wilson, 2016). There is mounting scientific support for such a transformative approach to safeguard ecological functions and resilience for all food production and the supply of ecosystem services. This provides support to the conclusion that the world has reached a juncture where feeding humanity… must essentially occur on already transformed and existing agricultural land… safeguarding the remaining ‘half Earth’ under natural forests and other ecosystems…
>
> *(Food, biosphere, and water)*


- The text works through consequences and strategies consistent with Half-Earth—land-sparing via intensification, diet change, waste reduction, protected areas—and offers criteria for success (increased yields, diet shifts, forest trajectories): 

> For land that is in agriculture use… this means modification of agricultural practices to minimize environmental damage and maximize resilience… precision farming… no-till… agro-ecology… improved harvesting…
>
> *(Food, biosphere and water)*

 

> Global forest cover decreased… in the SSP2. The opposite is the case in… pathways toward sustainability where the forests increase because land is ‘returned to nature’… In the SSP1 1.9 range, the upper case is depicted by scenarios that implement land-saving practices such as higher, sustainable yields, reduction of food waste… and changing dietary practices.
>
> *(Figure 10 caption)*


- It uses Half-Earth-inspired logic to define goals, indicators, and outcomes (e.g., stabilizing or increasing forest cover while meeting food security): 

> The requirement of protection of biodiversity… implies a reduction of total agricultural land… scenarios show this requires stabilization or increases in forest area and significant increases in yields…
>
> *(3.1.2.4 Food, biosphere and water)*

 

> Yields continue to increase… The transformation to sustainability needs land-saving practices to leave ‘half Earth’ to nature and at the same time mitigate environmental degradation and to build resilience into agricultural production systems.
>
> *(Figure 11 caption)*


- The report integrates Half-Earth with broader policy and governance recommendations (hypotheticals/negotiations): 

> Diet changes to less meat-intensive diets and reducing food waste… can mitigate land pressure (SDG 15) and decrease food prices, mitigating hunger… It is possible to avoid these trade-offs via agricultural intensification although this will require the management of possible environmental impacts from increased water use… or the use of fertilizers.

## Score 2: Theoretical Treatment

### IMPLEMENTATION AND METRICS

#### IUCNWILD16: Wilderness protected areas: management guidelines for IUCN Category 1b protected areas

- **Organisation**: IUCN
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Applied/Practice-Based

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the Half Earth (Nature Needs Half/Half-Earth) destination is discussed as a theoretical/scientific vision and motivating target, but without detailed policy mechanisms in this document for implementation. - The report situates Half Earth/Nature Needs Half as a science-based global vision connected to wilderness protection: 

> The science-based global vision of Nature Needs Half—protection of at least half of the world’s terrestrial and marine ecosystems—is supported by prominent scientists... Wilson (whose similar work is referred to as ‘Half Earth’).
>
> *(1.2)*

 - It links the destination to broader governance agendas and biodiversity targets (Promise of Sydney) showing conceptual relevance: 

> Protecting new wilderness areas and enhancing the current protection of wilderness is vital to both the Nature Needs Half vision and the vision outlined within the ‘Promise of Sydney’.
>
> *(1.2)*

 - It uses the destination to justify scale/connectivity outcomes (practical implications), though specific legal tools are outside this guideline: 

> Roughly half of any given ecoregion will need to be protected in an interconnected way to achieve the four goals of conservation biology and to achieve the Nature Needs Half concept.
>
> *(2.1)*

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### UNLAND17_2: The Global Land Outlook: Part 2 - The Outlook

- **Organisation**: UNCCD
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report presents the Half-Earth/Nature Needs Half idea as a conceptual destination (keep ~50% of land in a more or less natural state), but treats it as an emerging viewpoint to guide ambition rather than specifying operational pathways, institutional mechanisms, or negotiated implementation.

- Conceptual articulation of the 50% destination and its rationale to maintain ecosystem services and biodiversity: 

> There is a growing body of thought that suggests at least 50 per cent of the world’s land surface should remain in a more or less natural state to ensure continuation of vital ecosystem services and the biodiversity that underpins them. Furthermore, this half of the planet needs to include sufficient quantities of all ecosystems; it is not enough to maintain deserts, high mountains, and other lands with low potential for exploitation.
>
> *(Chapter 9, Protection)*


- It situates Half-Earth as one element within a triad (protection, sustainable management, restoration) rather than a stand-alone program with instruments: 

> One effective way of maintaining natural landscapes is through official or unofficial protected areas: areas of land and water set aside as refuges for biodiversity and ecosystem services... They are defined by the IUCN World Commission on Protected Areas...
>
> *(Chapter 9, Protection)*

#### IPBESMODELS46: Report of the IPBES task force on scenarios and models – Nature Futures Scenarios

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report explicitly contrasts ‘Half Earth’ and ‘Whole Earth’ visions as conceptual inputs for transformative scenarios, but does not propose an operational adoption of Half Earth.

- The report uses Half Earth/Whole Earth as scenario framings to explore implications: “The NFF enables thinking about transformative change by positioning humans as part of the natural system. The framework could support the identification of transformative pathways needed to achieve positive Nature Futures. For example, ‘Whole Earth’ versus ‘Half Earth’ visions and scenarios would require transformations to be achieved.” (III.B.d)

- It acknowledges divergent strategies to reach similar ends (degrowth/governance vs protected-area expansion): “In contrast, the ‘Whole Earth’ vision proposes an equally radical alternative… through degrowth… and cutting inequality in half to ensure people can live within ecological boundaries as part of nature…” (III.B, footnote 18)

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### IPANP24: The Undemocratic Origins Of The Nature Positive Plan

- **Organisation**: IPA
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because Half Earth is explicitly discussed as a key intellectual precursor to 30x30 and Nature Positive, with detailed critical engagement, but the source neither endorses nor operationalizes it for more-than-human empowerment.

- The document positions Half Earth as the intellectual origin of 30x30: 

> The ‘Nature Positive’ concept can be traced back to the advocacy of Edward O. Wilson (2016) for conserving, not 30 per cent, but fully 50 per cent of the surface of the Earth to halt a claimed crisis in biodiversity loss... Perhaps recognising that 50 per cent was a bit ambitious, Wilson’s disciples settled for 30 per cent in a series of papers.
>
> *(p. 3–4)*


- It quotes criticism of the 30% target as arbitrary, undermining the Half Earth lineage: 

> Eric Dinerstein... was quoted as saying ‘there’s no scientific basis for 30 percent.’... Dinerstein admitted of 30 per cent that ‘It’s arbitrary’.
>
> *(p. 4)*


- The text frames Half Earth within a broader critique of activist science and soft law: 

> Nature Positive and 30x30 have been evolved by means of incremental forum shopping based on scientific opinion pieces by activist scientists and NGOs.
>
> *(p. 3)*

## Score 1: Token Acknowledgement

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### IPBESTCA2: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 2. Visions of a sustainable world – for nature and people

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because Half-Earth is invoked as an example within eco-social imaginaries, but without further development or implementation detail in this chapter.

- Half-Earth appears among diverse ideas for new imaginaries: 

> Diverse ideas include initiatives such as Wilson’s advocacy for half Earth (E. Wilson, 2016), rights of nature...
>
> *(2.4.2)*


- Prevents higher score: no elaboration on policies, targets, or governance associated with Half-Earth here.

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### UNLAND17_3: The Global Land Outlook: Part 3 - A More Secure Future

- **Organisation**: UNCCD
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because the Half-Earth destination is mentioned as one position in a debate on how much conservation is needed, but it is presented briefly and not adopted or developed into proposals or governance mechanisms in this document.

- The report describes Half-Earth as an argument in an ongoing discussion rather than a recommended pathway: 

> There is a growing recognition among scientists, indigenous people, and civil society that there must be a limit to the human transformation of the environment in order to safeguard the provision of ecosystem services for future generations. Some argue that we need to conserve half of the Earth in a natural state and that these areas need to be fully representative in terms of ecosystems and biodiversity; it is not enough to conserve mountains tops, deserts, and ice fields. Natural areas need to be linked through biological corridors or other forms of connectivity to avoid ecosystems becoming isolated and genetically impoverished over time.
>
> *(Part Three – Box 4: How much conservation do we need?)*


- The text situates this view within broader policy targets (Aichi, SDGs), signaling neutrality rather than endorsement: 

> Currently around 15 per cent of global land is in a protected area, with an unknown amount in ‘other effective area-based conservation measures’ (OECMs)... Given that the 17 per cent goal was set before an OECM was defined, the area target agreed by the international community will likely increase after 2020, although this debate is ongoing. Two questions are intertwined: how much land should be retained in a near-natural state and how should this be managed?
>
> *(Part Three – Box 4)*


- The document does not develop Half-Earth into concrete steps or institutional proposals here; instead it discusses protected areas and OECMs generally, hence a brief, non-operational mention.
