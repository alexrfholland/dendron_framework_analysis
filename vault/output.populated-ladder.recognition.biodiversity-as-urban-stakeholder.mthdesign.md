## Score 4: Actionable Mechanisms

### IMPLEMENTATION AND METRICS

#### D4C25: Design for Environmental Conservation (Toolkit)

- **Organisation**: None
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Design/Engineering

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because D4C is explicitly a more-than-human, multispecies, ecocentric, participatory design methodology with concrete, actionable tools (personas incl. nonhumans, canvases, blueprints, growth plans) to include nonhumans in practical decision-making and delivery. 

- More-than-human, interspecies orientation: “Design for Conservation (D4C) aims to offer an alternative: a participatory, decolonial, multi-species, and distributed methodology… combining scientific knowledge with other types of wisdom.” (Ch.1)

- Concrete tools centered on multispecies participation: “Stakeholder Characterization… Types of Personas… 2. Non-Human Personas: These represent species, ecosystems, or other natural elements affected by the project… because these personas will not have a voice in the projects, team members and specialists can be their advocates.” (Ch.7)

- Delivery mechanisms: “Service Blueprint: Orchestrate and visualize the delivery of your project… Contextual System Map: Understand the relationships and flows in your project.” (Ch.8, Ch.10)

- Criteria and indicators for success: “Sustainability Radar and Checklist… evaluate how your project addresses strategies such as renewable materials, responsible consumption, context-based regeneration… Advanced Impact Planning Canvas aligning with SDGs.” (Ch.9)

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### EUECOLOPES25: ECOlogical Building enveLOPES: A Game-Changing Design Approach for Regenerative Urban Ecosystems

- **Organisation**: Ludwig
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because the project uses a more-than-human/interspecies design approach as the core guiding framework and operationalizes it through concrete, actionable mechanisms: explicit multi-species design goals, nonhuman KPIs, computational tools (Rhino/Grasshopper plugin), knowledge graphs, and an ontology that architects can implement in practice to design ecolopes that empower nonhuman inhabitants.

- Context/synthesis: The project vision is explicitly a multi-species design of building envelopes that act as living ecosystems for humans, plants, animals, and microbiota, framing nonhumans as co-inhabitants with design requirements. 

> ECOLOPES proposes a radical change... we aim at urbanization to be planned and designed such that nature - including humans - can co-evolve within the city... The aim of ECOLOPES is the envelope into an ecolope, a multi-species living space for four types of inhabitants, humans, plants, animals, and microbiota.

> To enable a systematic approach, ECOLOPES Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s) measure the consequences of a particular design... for abundance of the non-human inhabitants (e.g., Local PFGs richness, Structural Connectivity)... nested hierarchies... systematically link multispecies stakeholder objectives to measurable KPIs... stakeholder-specific KPIs, and spatially-explicit KPIs
>
> *(Description of expertise; WP6)*


- Context/synthesis: The approach is deployed on real sites (Vienna, Munich, Genoa, Tel Aviv) with multi-criteria simulations and validation, demonstrating feasibility and pathways to impact. 

> Simulations were conducted across the four design cases for Vienna, Munich, Genoa, and Tel Aviv, allowing the assessment of how local data and environmental parameters influence the design outcomes.
>
> *(WP6)*


- Context/synthesis: It articulates goals and indicators for nonhuman flourishing within built forms, a hallmark of more-than-human design. 

> The objective was thus to develop a novel design approach that not only focusses on humans, but also includes other organisms such as plants, animals, and even microorganisms... enabling practitioners to find architectural solutions that facilitate synergies from a multi-species perspective.

#### DWILD20: Designing wildlife-inclusive cities

- **Organisation**: None
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because the paper introduces and details 'wildlife-inclusive urban design' with concrete mechanisms (interdisciplinary teams, species life-cycle integration, post-occupancy monitoring, participatory approaches) and connects to Animal-Aided Design, offering clear steps for implementation in planning cycles. 

- Foundational definition and goal: “Here, we introduce the concept of ‘wildlife-inclusive urban design’ for the built-up area of cities that integrates animal needs into the urban planning and design process… enable urban environments where humans and animals can thrive in the built-up areas.” (Abstract; 1. Introduction)

- Mechanisms and criteria: “features of successful wildlife-inclusive urban design projects are: 1) interdisciplinary design teams that involve ecologists early on, 2) consideration of the entire life-cycle of target species, 3) post-occupancy monitoring and evaluation… and 4) stakeholder involvement and participatory approaches.” (Abstract)

- Planning cycle and steps: “we link these principles to the urban design planning cycle to illustrate how the concept can be implemented in practise… Analysis and Draft… Detailed Planning and Design… Realisation… Post-occupancy/monitoring.” (3.2; Fig. 2)

- Tooling and species-led design: “Animal-Aided Design… enables architects and landscape architects to integrate species habitat needs into their normal workflow… target species portraits that cover all critical habitat needs and possible interactions with humans and that can serve as planning aids.” (3.1)

- **Organisation**: UNESCO IOC
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because co-design is central and operationalized with explicit mechanisms, timelines, and institutional roles (DCO theory of change, best-practice portfolio, training networks, survey tools, GOOS integration), making it an actionable design approach to embed more-than-human ethics. - Context/synthesis: Co-design is mandated as a core driver, with outputs, actors, and deadlines.

#### ICNATUREPOS24: Blueprint for a Nature-Positive Adelaide

- **Organisation**: Interdisciplinary Conservation Science Group
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because the report operationalizes a more-than-human design approach (Biodiversity Sensitive Urban Design as design for biodiversity/net-positive design), including a formal process, co-design workshops with stakeholders, detailed principles, design rules, metrics, integration into the planning system, and case studies, thus providing concrete, replicable mechanisms for empowering nonhumans in urban design.

- The document defines and centers BSUD as the design mechanism to embed nonhuman needs, making this the backbone of the guidance: 

> Biodiversity Sensitive Urban Design (BSUD) is a protocol and process for urban design that aims to create urban environments that are a net benefit to native species and ecosystems through the provision of essential habitat and food resources (Garrard et al. 2018).

 It sets five principles including habitat maintenance, facilitating dispersal, minimizing threats, enabling natural processes, and facilitating positive human–nature interactions. (Section 4.1 What is BSUD?)

- It details a participatory co-design process and shows how objectives are co-developed with planners, ecologists, community and Traditional Owners, and then translated into designs: 

> One way to identify and articulate relevant biodiversity objectives is through stakeholder workshops... Bringing stakeholders together in this way ensured that biodiversity objectives reflected a diverse range of experiences, preferences and values and helped to ensure they were deliverable...

 and gives a case (Fishermans Bend) with co-design across agencies, ecologists, planning professionals and Traditional Owners. (Section 4.2.2 Identifying biodiversity objectives; Table 6)

- It provides a structured decision process linking objectives to design actions and metrics: 

> BSUD links urban design to measurable biodiversity outcomes... It includes a decision process that involves documenting biodiversity values, identifying biodiversity and development objectives, identifying potential BSUD actions, assessing those actions and reaching a final decision...

 This includes evaluation with species persistence (PVA), connectivity modelling, and resilience, and shows how these guide designs. (Section 4.2 How does BSUD work?; 4.2.4 Evaluate BSUD)

- It shows concrete, transferable design patterns for empowering target species (e.g., blue-banded bees, growling grass frog), with habitat analogues, nesting structures, midstorey and street-level design details, and wildlife-friendly lighting, illustrating operationalized more-than-human design: 

> Design solutions can include... nesting boxes... analogue nesting habitats (e.g. mudbrick features with specially drilled holes)... artificial structures such as road underpasses and animal ladders... Private gardens provide food and habitat resources...
>
> *(Section 4.2.3 Design to achieve biodiversity objectives; Melbourne Case Study 2: Averley)*


- It embeds the design approach into policy and delivery, explicitly mapping the process into the South Australian planning system and recommending a BSUD program for public open space and streetscapes: 

> Figure 10 illustrates how the BSUD process relates to the South Australian Planning system and project delivery.

 and 

> Establish a BSUD program for new public open space and retrofits for parks and streetscapes, starting with a ‘showpiece’ biodiverse park and set of biodiverse streets

 with concrete sub-actions (guidelines, verge planting guidance, aligning infrastructure upgrades, etc.). (Sections 4.2.5 Applying BSUD across scales; 9.2 Headline initiative 3)

## Score 3: Core Conceptual Device / Implications Explored

### IMPLEMENTATION AND METRICS

#### IRELANDAAD22: Southern Regional Assembly 2020 Annual Report

- **Organisation**: Southern Regional Assembly
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because Animal-Aided Design (AAD)—a named more-than-human design approach—is described in detail, including its mechanisms (selecting target species at project start; integrating species life-cycle needs into design) and its implications for implementation in the Southern Region via RSES, but the document stops short of providing concrete, locally-institutionalized steps or binding policies (hence not a 4).

- The source introduces AAD as a concrete more-than-human design framework and explains its core mechanism of integrating target species' life cycles into design from the outset, emphasizing species’ needs as design constraints and inspirations: 

> Animal-Aided Design (AAD) in Ingolstadt, Germany uses a species’ life cycle to improve open space planning and conservation. The basic idea of AAD is to include the presence of animals in the planning process, such that they are an integral part of the design. For AAD, the desired species are chosen at the beginning of a project. The requirements of the target species then not only set framework conditions for the design, but also serve as an inspiration for the design itself. The aim of AAD is to establish a stable population at the project site or contribute to population growth of species with larger habitats. AAD thus allows a combination of good urban design with species conservation.
>
> *(Section 7, Blue Green City – International Good Practices)*


- The document explicitly discusses the practical implications of AAD for conflict-avoidance and alignment between conservation and planning, demonstrating conceptual application to empower nonhuman species (their needs shape design outcomes): 

> Selecting target species for AAD at the beginning of the planning process avoids the conflict between the design of urban green spaces and conservation. It avoids this conflict by making the habitat requirements of target species to become an integral part of project design, aligning species conservation and the planning process, without delay to the planning process and without surprises.
>
> *(Section 7, Blue Green City – International Good Practices)*


- The framework is connected to regional implementation goals, indicating intent to translate the concept into practice for RSES aims (placemaking and climate resilience), i.e., considering outcomes and criteria for success (stable populations, new habitats, climate resilience): 

> The AAD approach recognises that to create green and blue infrastructure, biodiversity needs to be mainstreamed into current planning strategies, to find solutions that benefit both humans and other species at the same development site. This will not only protect the biodiversity present at a planning location, but it will also create new habitats that would otherwise not be there. This will be extremely important and applicable to the Southern Region’s Metropolitan Areas and Key Towns in achieving ambitious RSES policy objectives relating to placemaking and Climate Resilience.
>
> *(Section 7, Blue Green City – International Good Practices)*


- The broader Blue-Green Infrastructure context is tied to implementation intent (though not yet institutionalized), showing the Assembly’s approach to adopt external good practices to implement the RSES: 

> Växjö have developed ‘Livable Streets - A Handbook of Bluegreengrey Systems’... With this method, a small surface area can provide multiple improvements at a lower cost than if the same functions are addressed separately. This is very applicable to the Southern Region and the Southern Regional Assembly aim to use this Good Practice for effective RSES implementation.
>
> *(Section 7, Blue Green City – International Good Practices)*


- The same section frames BGI/NBS as policy tools to be embedded in local authority Development Plans, further supporting the translation pathway for AAD-like approaches: 

> In addition, the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy (RSES) states that BGI and NBS should be a key concept of a local authority’s Development Plan, informing actions and strategy around economic development and placemaking.
>
> *(Section 7, Blue Green City)*


- What prevents a score of 4 is the absence of detailed, formalized local mechanisms such as a published AAD policy, binding standards, procurement templates, or an adopted action plan specifying steps, responsibilities, and metrics for AAD deployment in the Southern Region.

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### IUCNBUILD25: Catalysing biodiversity on buildings: a review of supporting initiatives in European cities

- **Organisation**: IUCN
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Design/Engineering

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the report frames and details interspecies/ecocentric design practices (animal-aided, bird-safe, lighting ecologies, native plants, habitat emulation) as core techniques with indicators and policies across multiple cities; it proposes concrete tools and outcomes. - It presents interspecies design elements as central to building standards: “measures to safeguard wildlife against building hazards like reflective surfaces... nesting boxes and refuge for pollinators.” (Section 2) - It advances native-species and habitat-emulation design criteria (Zurich, Basel, Paris) to empower local fauna/flora: “use of (at least a majority proportion) native vegetation; emulation of local habitats; utilisation of local soils... both cities incentivise native planting... higher the ecological value... the greater the financial support...” (4.2) - It showcases comprehensive performance frameworks that integrate biodiversity design into development (Toronto Green Standard, UGF/BAF): “The Toronto Green Standard... Ecology and Biodiversity... bird collision deterrence... native plant species and pollinator plantings...” (4.4) - It defines design success metrics and trade-offs, including technical tools for practitioners: “Metrics and tools... Urban Greening Factor tool... Biotope Area Factor... Green replacement/Green factor policies.” (2.4; 4.1.2)

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### ADELPLAN21: Green Adeliade Regional Landscape Plan 2021—26. Pathway to a Cooler, Greener, Wilder and Climate-Resilient Adelaide

- **Organisation**: Department for Environment and Water and State of South Australia
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the Regional Landscape Plan explicitly prioritizes Biodiversity Sensitive Urban Design (design for biodiversity) and commits to influencing, incentivizing, and building capacity for this approach across developments and public spaces, considering implications and outcomes, though it provides fewer detailed mechanisms than the Blueprint.

- BSUD is a legislated priority with clear goal and outcomes: “Biodiversity sensitive and water sensitive urban design. Goal: Build industry and community capacity to design cooler, greener and nature-friendly developments and infrastructure.” (Our seven priorities)

- The plan specifies focus areas and intended outcomes that embed the design approach across scales and sectors: “BW1 Influence and incentivise best practice BSUD and WSUD in new developments, major transport corridors, public open spaces and local streetscapes… BW2 Catalyse and partner on research and other tools to address barriers to implementation and identify opportunities for innovation… BW3 Build community, council and industry knowledge, motivation and capacity…” (Priority BW1–BW3)

- It integrates BSUD with other priorities (green streets, water resources, coastal management), indicating implications for multiple systems and stakeholders: “Issues arising from urbanisation such as flooding, the provision of green space, urban heat island effects… can be addressed through a stronger adoption of water sensitive urban design (WSUD) and biodiversity sensitive urban design (BSUD)… Adopting these designs in development at every scale will help to ensure Adelaide is liveable, productive, biodiverse and resilient…” (Biodiversity sensitive and water sensitive urban design)

#### UNCITIES21: Global environment outlook for cities – towards green and just cities (GEO for Cities)

- **Organisation**: UNEP & UN-Habitat
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the report advances more-than-human design practices (multispecies urban planning, biodiversity corridors, pollinator pathways, nature-based infrastructures) to achieve stated outcomes (livability, resilience, biodiversity), but does not standardize a single design manual; instead, it presents a suite of actionable practices and case indicators.

- Design practices articulated: 

> Urban biodiversity plans and habitat designs... create single and multispecies habitat and landscape corridors... restoration of estuaries and wetlands... green roofs and walls... to build in redundancy with stormwater and flood controls and mitigate urban heat island effects.
>
> *(Chapter 4, 4.2.2 and 4.2.3)*


- Co-design and social innovation emphasis: 

> Nature-based solutions... need to be aesthetically appealing to citizens while generating new green urban commons based on participatory co-creation, social innovation and collaborative governance (Frantzeskaki 2019).
>
> *(Chapter 4, 4.2.2)*


- Outcomes and measures: Bee highways/pollinator districts, precautionary zones, multispecies disaster plans provide criteria and goals to guide design success. (Chapter 4, Figure 4.3; 4.2.3)
