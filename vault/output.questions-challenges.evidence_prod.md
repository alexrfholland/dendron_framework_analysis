# EVIDENCE_PROD: Evidence production

## Sources and Questions

### ICNATUREPOS24: Blueprint for a Nature-Positive Adelaide

**Question**: How can cities develop and fund robust monitoring frameworks that measure biodiversity outcomes rather than proxies?

**Evidence**: “To be able to understand the impact of biodiversity initiatives, monitoring and measurement of success needs to be integrated into the project design from the beginning. However, most (81%) survey respondents indicated that monitoring was not included in project budgets... few formally measured faunal use of the site after the project ended.” (Section 6.7)

### SCTRANSS25: Environment strategy for Scotland – transformative changes for sustainability

**Question**: What constitutes evidence of ‘transformative’ outcomes, and how can targeted, robust monitoring be designed to capture deep leverage shifts?

**Evidence**: “There is not yet a consensus on what sustainability transformations constitute... specific challenges were identified in assessing whether a policy instrument is transformative or not... because there has been limited evidence-gathering to date and challenges of attribution.” (4. Challenges in Transformative Change Theory)

### TWITRANS18: Transformations to achieve the sustainable development goals

**Question**: What research and modeling advances are required to generate actionable, integrated pathways across SDGs?

**Evidence**: “Today, no science-based pathways exist for successfully achieving all SDGs simultaneously. The global transformations necessary to achieve the SDGs urgently need a robust scientific foundation and fact-based way forward… TWI2050 is a global multi-year… research initiative designed to help address these issues.” (Introduction, Why TWI2050 is needed)
“This approach is the first goal-based, multi-model quantitative and qualitative integrated analysis that encompasses the full set of SDGs… The successful identification of sustainable development pathways (SDPs) requires a comprehensive, robust approach that spans across disciplines and methodologies.” (1.3 TWI2050 framework)

### UNLAND17_1: The Global Land Outlook: Part 1 - The Big Picture

**Question**: How can we improve the production of robust, harmonized evidence on land degradation given widely varying global estimates and indicator limitations?

**Evidence**: 

> Global estimates of the amount of degraded land vary widely, from 1 billion to 6 billion hectares, which illustrates both the scale of the problem and the need for more accurate data.
>
> *(Chapter 3, Drivers of Change, p. 43)*

> Considering the drivers and multiple factors underlying land degradation and the need for context-specific responses, developing a single indicator or index to represent or map land degradation represents a big challenge.
>
> *(Chapter 4, Convergence of Evidence, p. 53)*

### IPBESTCA2: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 2. Visions of a sustainable world – for nature and people

**Question**: How can we better document, track, and assess the transformative impacts of visions and their development processes across scales?

**Evidence**: “Challenges in assessing transformative potential of visions: tracking the tangible impacts of visions, particularly on a global and cross-scale basis, is difficult, as many published visions do not document outcomes… Disentangling the role of visions from other drivers and processes in achieving outcomes is challenging.” “Lack of documentation of visioning processes: there is frequently a lack of clear description of mechanisms and concrete examples on how visions were developed.” (2.6. Knowledge Gaps)

### EUINVASIVE24: IPBES Invasive Alien Species Assessment: Chapter 1. Introducing Biological Invasions and the IPBES Thematic Assessment of Invasive Alien Species and Their Control

**Question**: How can modelling and scenarios for IAS be advanced to produce informative predictions and robust projections across scales?

**Evidence**: - Context/synthesis: The chapter outlines methodological needs and current gaps in scenarios and models for IAS. “The prevention, early detection and management of biological invasions will consequently benefit from increased knowledge, more informative predictions, and accurate and plausible future scenarios... Until recently... biological invasion scenarios have not been available.” (Section 1.6.7.3)

- Context/synthesis: It summarizes the state of modelling (e.g., limited representation of cross-cutting themes) and calls for integration with biodiversity scenario frameworks. “Currently, biological invasions are not included in existing global integrated assessment models, but such an integration would be highly beneficial... IPBES has developed a framework... the Nature Futures Framework... considerable potential for exploring the role of invasive alien species in future biodiversity change.” (Section 1.6.7.3)

### EUECOSERVG2021: Ecosystem services accounting – part III

**Question**: How can accounts be designed to be both broad (spatially and temporally) and consistent, given methodological complexity and data needs?

**Evidence**: “All these points are relevant, and there are several long-standing historical challenges in creating accounts that are both broad (encompassing many services over large areas and a long time scale) and consistent (in terms of their implementation details).” (Chapter 1)
“Concepts and methods will need to be further developed and improved alongside the increase in ecosystem accounting applications. Thanks to the basic guidelines provided by SEEA EA, we have a common ground to refer to; however, this field is very complex, and more time and more concrete experiences will be required before reaching a final, comprehensive set of recommendations.” (Chapter 2.5)

---

### UNLEGAL: Environmental rule of law: tracking progress and charting future directions

**Question**: How can environmental rule of law be tracked consistently, given the difficulty of objectively measuring implementation and enforcement beyond binary indicators?

**Evidence**: “Developing and regularly updating a standardized set of environmental rule of law indicators would allow governments, international organizations and civil society to track progress, identify challenges and set priorities. Objectively measuring implementation and enforcement of environmental law is difficult. The choice of indicators is often not straightforward: it is not sufficient to count the number of cases brought, investigations conducted or sentences imposed.” (Chapter 6, Section 6.2.1)

---

### EUONEHEALTH24: One Health governance in the European Union

**Question**: What standardised methods can demonstrate benefits and costs of One Health beyond zoonoses, and integrate environmental and animal outcomes?

**Evidence**: “Despite widely cited benefits of One Health approaches, few studies have actually measured effects based on implementation studies... there was no agreed methodology for the cost benefit estimates.” (Leverage points – Literature review, systematic reviews)
“Costs and benefits are rarely assessed in One Health-related projects... when assessed... often seen from a human-centric point of view... unintended consequences... remain invisible.” (Leverage points – Literature review synthesis)

### IPBESPATHWAYS19: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 5. Realizing a sustainable world for nature and people: transformative strategies, actions and roles for all

**Question**: How can research projects be designed to cover multiple dimensions of transformative action to provide robust scientific background for deliberate transformative change?

**Evidence**: 

> Overall, there is a need for research projects that cover all these dimensions of transformative action to provide better scientific background on deliberate transformative change.
>
> *(Box 5.3)*

### CAGENE23: Framing challenges and opportunities for Canada – Expert panel on regulating gene-edited organisms for pest control

**Question**: How can Canada build an evidence base for genetic pest control given the paucity of empirical data and technological readiness?

**Evidence**: 

> The eviden​ce base is currently limited and will need to be expanded to identify the relevant strengths, limitations, and risks... In early stages, it will be crucial to adopt a case-by-case and adaptive approach to risk assessment.
>
> *(Executive Summary; Chapter 4.1)*



---

### IBPESWILD22: Chapter 2: Conceptualizing the sustainable use of wild species

**Question**: How can indicator frameworks be periodically revised to reflect evolving knowledge and public dialogue on sustainable use?

**Evidence**: “These targets and indicators will therefore require periodic revision, as knowledge and experience grow and public policy dialogue progresses (well established).” (Executive Summary, point 11)

---

### PBLCITIES21: Realising the Urban Opportunity: Cities and the Post-2020 Biodiversity Governance

**Question**: How can targets be made SMART and CUTE for urban contexts despite data and capacity constraints?

**Evidence**: “As noted by the IPBES Global Assessment, current approaches to setting and monitoring targets… have been hampered by a lack of data… targets need not only to be SMART but also CUTE — Comprehensive, Understandable, Time-bound and Enabling… targets will need to be designed so as to tackle related issues in an integrated manner, be readily translated and understood in an urban context…” (Section 3.1)

---

### NZOCEAN21: The breaking wave: reforming the oceans management system in Aotearoa New Zealand

**Question**: Lack of a coherent environmental research strategy for oceans; data often not aggregated or accessible across agencies.

**Evidence**: “the lack of a coherent research strategy for environmental issues more broadly... Datasets often do not speak well to each other, and research is often stored in an unstructured way and can be lost and then sometimes replicated.” (Chapter 3.3)
“Fisheries information... is inherently uncertain... reliable CPUE data has only been available since 1990... most species do not have sufficient data to undertake quantitative assessments.” (Chapter 8.2)

---

### EURIGHTS: Towards an EU Charter of the Fundamental Rights of Nature

**Question**: How should EU REFIT and impact assessment incorporate ecological science (PBs, tipping points) to guide decisions affecting nonhumans?

**Evidence**: “Analyses and impact assessments must take into account all these factors... the ‘eco-legal’ breaking points describe an ‘urgent’, ‘pejorative’, ‘existential threat’ scenario... Therefore, with the recognition of the Rights of Nature, the EU IA/REFIT system should introduce new ecosystem strategies, such as: the introduction of an integrated long-term approach... the affirmation of the primacy of safeguarding the Rights of Nature... the introduction of the ecological and economic analysis of Law...” (Section 7.4, p. 129-131)

---

### COMESTWATER22: Report of COMEST on water ethics: ocean, freshwater and coastal areas

**Question**: What scientific baselines, indicators, and reviews are needed to manage cumulative, transboundary, and climate-related impacts on water systems?

**Evidence**: “Among the problems are also scientific issues due to a need for: a. systematic reviews of the state of the ocean… b. baseline studies and reference data… e. limited ability to detect and predict indirect and cumulative effects.” (II.3 Ocean Governance)
“Periodic reports of water related quantitative indicators should be developed and adopted by the relevant scientific communities.” (VII.c.v Role of Scientific Knowledge and Research)

---

### UNESCOBIO11: Ethics and biodiversity

**Question**: Measurement and definition of biodiversity are difficult, complicating evidence production and policy relevance.

**Evidence**: “The difficulties in measuring biodiversity have yet to be completely removed... Conceptually, the difficulty lay in the deep interconnected nature of biodiversity and its ecosystem... Combined with the practical difficulty of collecting the required field data due to a short supply of time, money and experts needed for proper sampling... ‘Such a definition is of little use to conservation biologists trying to develop and evaluate methodologies for biodiversity measurement …’” (1.4 Measuring Biodiversity)
