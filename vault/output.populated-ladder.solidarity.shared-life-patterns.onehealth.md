## Score 4: Actionable Mechanisms

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### EUONEHEALTH24: One Health governance in the European Union

- **Organisation**: SAPEA
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because One Health is the foundational framework of the report and is operationalised with concrete, actionable mechanisms (governance steps, indicators, institutional platforms, case studies, funding levers), including a 15-step operationalisation checklist, theory of change, evaluation toolboxes, and EU policy implementation pathways and taskforces.

- The report adopts and refines One Health as the core definition and basis for all subsequent governance and implementation work, signalling a shift away from anthropocentrism toward ecosystem health: 

> One Health is an integrated, unifying approach that aims to sustainably balance and optimise the health of ecosystems. It recognizes the health of humans, domestic and wild animals, and the environment are closely linked and interdependent... A paradigm shift has occurred in how the One Health concept is understood, with the scope expanding from the previous anthropocentric framing, although the conditions for making practical changes are not yet present.
>
> *(Executive summary – Definition of One Health; One Health definition in the EU context)*


- The report provides a practical, stepwise governance mechanism (Box 1/Box 4) that institutions can implement to operationalise One Health across sectors and scales, including leadership, coordination, stakeholder mapping, theory of change, and iterative implementation: 

> We present a ‘checklist’ for operationalising One Health, developed from the OHHLEP Theory of Change for One Health... 1. Introduce top leadership... 2. Create a One Health coordination platform... 4. Formulate a theory of change... 5. Identify and map stakeholders... 6. Engage in a participatory transdisciplinary stakeholder process... 11. Implement One Health issue at small scale... 14. Scale up the implementation... 15. Iterate steps 9–14.
>
> *(Executive summary – Criteria and indicators; Chapter 3, Box 4)*


- It details a theory of change and provides a comprehensive indicators toolbox (qualitative and quantitative), enabling measurement, evaluation and continuous optimisation, thereby turning the framework into an implementable policy cycle: 

> We present a ‘checklist’... which summarises the governance and participatory processes that lead to One Health interventions... a literature review summarises the state of knowledge on how qualitative and quantitative indicators are used to evaluate One Health... We conclude that... the currently available indicators are sufficient to evaluate the effectiveness of EU policies in operationalising One Health.
>
> *(Executive summary – Criteria and indicators)*


- It maps EU institutional mechanisms and establishes a cross-agency One Health Taskforce with explicit aims for coordination, research agenda-setting, shared advice, and joint activities, demonstrating institutionalisation pathways: 

> This conference led to the establishment of a cross-agency One Health taskforce... 1. Facilitate strategic coordination... 2. promote research coordination and One Health-driven agenda setting; 3. Forum for the coordination of activities and scientific advice... 4. Strengthen joint activities and the sharing of information on One Health aspects among the agencies...
>
> *(EU policies – One Health taskforce and the 2023 EU Joint Statement)*


- It provides worked EU policy applications (alignment matrix) and actionable governance levers (e.g., integrating One Health into Farm to Fork, Crisis Preparedness, EU Biodiversity Strategy; knowledge-broker models; financing blends), showing practical routes to implementation: 

> In the EU, policies such as: the Farm to Fork Strategy, the Crisis Preparedness legislation, and the EU Biodiversity Strategy, among others, could benefit from a greater emphasis on a One Health approach... One Health knowledge-brokering agencies or 'boundary organisations' may improve transboundary knowledge mobilisation and collaboration.
>
> *(EU policies – Summary and Key messages)*


- It develops concrete case studies with demonstrated outcomes, costs/benefits, and institutional lessons (AMR surveillance, West Nile integrated SRS, trichinosis control, urban One Health, integrated labs, animal-assisted interventions), demonstrating how the framework translates into practice: 

> These case studies illustrate the focus to date on infectious diseases and the lack of assessment of the benefits of One Health approaches... They also demonstrate the importance of political ownership, clear governance structures and dedicated funding to support the implementation of One Health interventions.
>
> *(Executive summary – Leverage points; Chapter 4 case studies)*


- It translates the conceptual framework into specific policy options, goals, and indicators across ethical, scientific, technical, and political domains (e.g., integrated surveillance-response systems, joint labs, evaluation standards, grant conditions), including horizon scanning and risk prevention: 

> Evidence-based policy options include: Implementing integrated AMR and zoonoses surveillance... Establishing an integrated laboratory and surveillance-response infrastructure... Supporting improved evaluation of and research in the benefits of One Health operationalisation...
>
> *(Chapter 5 – Evidence-based options for policy)*

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### ISCHEALTH21: Urban health and wellbeing in the Anthropocene: interdisciplinary science-action plan 2021–2025

- **Organisation**: ISC/ISUH/IAP
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because planetary health is central to the plan’s shift and is operationalized through concrete, actionable mechanisms (e.g., Health in All Policies implementation, Xiamen Call for Action principles with measurable indicators, development of Data-Knowledge-Action Systems, training/MOOC, and collaborations with WHO/UN-Habitat), thereby extending health considerations beyond humans to living systems and Earth system functions. - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: The plan’s thesis explicitly extends human health to the health of other living systems and planetary health as the core paradigm for urban governance: 

> The systems approach... puts health to its center, however, extends the notion of human health to the health of other living systems on which human health and prosperity depend. In doing so it has crossed disciplinary boundaries... The impact... has shown us how urban, peri-urban, rural and natural environments are all interlinked and interdependent determinants of planetary health.
>
> *(Foreword; p. 2 context)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: The Summary codifies the planetary health shift and its implications for goals and actions, embedding it as the guiding framework: 

> This New Science Plan (2021-2025)... deviates from its 2011 predecessor in that it makes a shift from ‘improving health and wellbeing of people in cities’ to ‘improving population and planetary health in the context of complex urban systems’. The fundamental difference lies in the recognition that in an age of the Anthropocene a less anthropocentric and more eco-centric view is essential.
>
> *(Summary)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: The plan sets out specific actions to implement the integrated health paradigm in policy and practice (HiAP and Xiamen Call), demonstrating operational mechanisms and intended outcomes: 

> Goal 1: Support efforts for implementing ‘Health in All Policies’ and the ‘Xiamen Call for Action’. Actions: Collaborate with the InterAcademy Partnership’s working group on urban health to define projects and deliverables for demonstrating how to integrate health in all policies. Liaise with WHO and UN-Habitat... to identify opportunities of where and how health can be integrated into urban policies.
>
> *(Section 3; Table 2)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: The Xiamen Call for Action principles include measurable indicators and precaution, providing governance criteria and negotiation principles across sectors: 

> Governing urban complexity... can be facilitated by adhering to the principles outlined in the Xiamen Call for Action: ... 4. Health and wellbeing as performance indicators which need to be measured centrally and locally in all policies. 5. Risk sharing: stakeholders investing in and benefiting from cross-sectorial collaboration also share the costs. 6. Pre-cautionary principle: incorporates both the curative and preventive dimensions of health.
>
> *(Section 2.3)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: The plan operationalizes planetary health via data infrastructures and collaborative modelling that integrate environmental determinants, specifying implementation steps and partners: 

> Goal 2: Lead the development of an interdisciplinary research project on Data-Knowledge-Action Systems for Healthy and Resilient Cities, together with CODATA... Actions: Draft a concept note and elaborate a proposal for research and action on Urban Data-Knowledge-Action Systems... liaise with partners to implement potential demonstration projects.
>
> *(Section 3; Table 2)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: It further commits to capacity building and training for systemic planetary health practice in cities, detailing modes of delivery and audiences: 

> Goal 4: Inform and develop training, education and communication material... Actions: Develop a MOOC on A Systems Approach to Urban Health and Wellbeing... Training on the balance between human and planetary health in cities, particularly for city governments and NGOs. Training on collaborative modelling for urban health and wellbeing.
>
> *(Section 3; Table 2)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: The plan connects to global agreements (SDGs, Paris, Sendai, NUA) and explicitly frames planetary health as an integrating mechanism guiding outcomes across policy regimes: 

> The Global Sustainable Development Agenda 2030, the New Urban Agenda, the Paris Agreement and the Sendai Framework are all connected through health and wellbeing being a common goal... health needs to be regarded not only as an outcome of sustainable development, but sustainable development also needs to be a healthy process co-created by a healthy population, and a systemic condition of living (urban) systems and their functioning.
>
> *(Section 2.2)*

## Score 3: Core Conceptual Device / Implications Explored

### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### UNSECURITY24: Envisioning security for a more-than-human world

- **Organisation**: UNDP
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because ‘One Health’ is used as a core bridge for human–nonhuman security, with implications and some concrete examples (e.g., U.S. One Health Framework legislation), though the paper itself does not lay out a complete global implementation plan. - It defines the framework and rationale: “With a sense of urgency for planetary well-being, the task force declared that the ‘convergence of people, animals, and our environment has created a new dynamic in which the health of each group is inextricably interconnected’ and called for a ‘one health’ collaborative approach to conjoined human-environmental domains.” (One health for people, animals and our environment) - It shows actionable precedent: “In June and July 2019, bipartisan ‘one health’ congressional bills were introduced... to ‘develop, publish, and submit to Congress a national One Health Framework for coordinated federal activities under the One Health Program...’” (One Health section, US legislation example) - It connects to governance and practice: “Global health governance must involve a global-scale securitization strategy that recognizes the world’s transnational interconnections of threat and risk... We need to avoid falling into the trap of ‘technological fixes’... illustrating what is wrong with accepted... ideas like endless ‘economic growth’.” (Global health governance section)

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### EUINVASIVE24: IPBES Invasive Alien Species Assessment: Chapter 1. Introducing Biological Invasions and the IPBES Thematic Assessment of Invasive Alien Species and Their Control

- **Organisation**: Roy
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because One Health is presented as a core integrative framework linking human, animal, and ecosystem health; the chapter discusses implications (zoonoses, surveillance, governance), and proposes the complementary ‘One Biosecurity’ approach, but stops short of detailing binding institutional steps within this chapter.

- Context/synthesis: The chapter defines One Health and calls for integrating IAS into these approaches. “Planetary Health, EcoHealth, and One Health... The World Health Organization (WHO), FAO, and WOAH... have jointly defined One Health as ‘an integrated, unifying approach that aims to sustainably balance and optimize the health of people, animals and ecosystems.’... despite the critical role invasive alien species can play... these approaches have yet to systematically integrate the threat...” (Section 1.6.7.2)

- Context/synthesis: It works through implications for zoonotic disease and IAS management, drawing analogies between epidemics and invasions. “The role of invasive alien species in the transmission dynamics of emerging zoonotic diseases is often overlooked... Pathogenic microbes which cause human epidemics and pandemics are highly successful invasive alien species... A more biosecurity-focused approach has also been suggested: ‘One Biosecurity’ would integrate the One Health framework...” (Box 1.14; Section 1.6.7.2)

- Context/synthesis: It suggests goals and components (surveillance networks, regulatory parallels to IHR) that inform implementation pathways. “One Biosecurity could be informed through a streamlined approach to the prediction of emerging biosecurity risks... a global network of surveillance and information sharing, and coordinated international responses... underpinned by a regulatory framework that parallels the International Health Regulations of the WHO.” (Section 1.6.7.2)

#### UNLEGAL: Environmental rule of law: tracking progress and charting future directions

- **Organisation**: UNEP
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the One Health framework is explicitly used as a core conceptual policy approach connecting human, animal, and ecosystem health; the report works through implications for institutions, program priorities, and national integration, but stops short of providing step-by-step implementation toolkits in this report (hence not a 4).

- The report frames zoonoses and pandemic risk through One Health as a conceptual basis for environmental rule of law: 

> More broadly, the health and well-being of humans are dependent on a healthy environment, as expressed in the concept of ‘One Health’... As such, environmental rule of law is necessary to safeguard a healthy environment and reduce the risk of future outbreaks.
>
> *(Chapter 1, Section 1.3.1)*


- It proposes One Health as an integrated approach and positions it within national and intergovernmental institutional strategies: 

> The One Health approach takes a multi-sectoral approach to health, recognizing the interdependence of humans, animals and ecosystems. The FAO has identified One Health as a Programme Priority Area of its Strategic Framework 2022-2031, and countries such as Rwanda and Ethiopia are beginning to incorporate One Health into their institutions and programming.
>
> *(Chapter 2, Section 2.3.4)*


- The report develops policy implications (governance integration and rights considerations): 

> The pandemic underlines the links between environment, rights and health, and the cumulative nature of environmental injustice, creating an opportunity to better integrate environment-related rights in the new concept of One Health... The Special Rapporteur... called for integration of the right to a healthy environment into the effort to build back better.
>
> *(Chapter 4, Section 4.3.1)*


- It suggests outcomes and coordination goals (cross-sectoral integration, institutional cooperation): 

> Integrated approaches can significantly bolster environmental rule of law... At the national level, integrated approaches are realized through requirements and mechanisms for policy harmonization and institutional coordination...
>
> *(Chapter 2, Section 2.3.4)*

#### UNPLANETBOUND22: Thematic study: planetary boundaries

- **Organisation**: UNDRR
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the report uses One Health as a core conceptual device to link human and nonhuman health and explores implications and applications for DRR (ecosystem health monitoring, early warning, prevention orientation), but it does not supply fully specified institutional blueprints beyond these proposals. - The study situates One Health in a more-than-human prevention strategy: 

> Respecting Planetary Boundaries would foster environmental, animal, and human health... Ecosystem health should be monitored as an early warning system for future disease risk, with Planetary Boundaries providing a metric for global ecosystem stability... The UNDRR should lead a transition in disease management from crisis-response to risk preparedness and prevention.
>
> *(Part 3.6, How to strengthen risk-informed development)*

 - It links One Health to systemic risk governance: 

> The public health, livestock, and agriculture sectors... often adopt a ‘crisis response’ model... the COVID pandemic has highlighted the importance of understanding the systemic nature of risk and has highlighted the need to build resilience and preparedness as opposed to simply responding.
>
> *(Part 3.6, How is systemic risk relevant)*

 - It develops outcomes and indicators: 

> One Health... should be fully integrated into public health spheres... Ecosystem health should be monitored as an early warning system... Planetary Boundaries can be used as a metric for monitoring ecosystem health.
>
> *(Part 3.6, How to strengthen...)*

#### EUHORIZON23: Horizon Europe strategic plan 2025–2027 analysis

- **Organisation**: European Commission
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because One Health is explicitly advanced as a core lens to structure EU R&I priorities on infectious disease, AMR, and preparedness, including co-funded partnerships (e.g., One Health AMR partnership) and HERA, with clear implications for research portfolios and system design; however, while specific instruments are mentioned, the text stops short of detailing step-by-step implementation or binding policy mechanisms that would elevate nonhuman interests directly in governance.

- The document names One Health as necessary for strategy design and threat management, broadening the moral and analytical community beyond humans: 

> Adopting a One Health perspective is important for crafting strategies and countermeasures for tackling emerging health threats, in particular infections. These types of dynamics have been suggested to underlie outbreaks of Ebola-virus outbreaks and Covid-19 for example. It is also an important mechanism behind the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and continuing the fight of AMR with a special focus on the development of new antibiotics to tackle the market failure by the private sector is also critical.
>
> *(Section 3.4.2 – Protect our health and well-being)*


- It operationalises One Health within the R&I portfolio via partnerships and programmes, indicating consequences for funding and coordination: under health intervention gaps and actions it lists 

> Antimicrobial resistance (the one health antimicrobial resistance partnership)

 and calls for coordination with HERA on medical countermeasures. 

> Pandemic preparedness and response will need further investments, including those to ensure the development of appropriate medical countermeasures for serious cross-border health threats.
>
> *(Cluster 1 – Health gap analysis; Sections 3.4.2 and 3.2.1)*


- The R&I needs explicitly integrate nonhuman health and ecosystems (One Health scope) with climate and biodiversity: 

> interlinkage between health (humans, animals and the environment) and climate change

 and 

> New infectious agents with pandemic potential can arise out of interactions between humans, animals, and changing environmental conditions.
>
> *(Box 7; Section 3.4.2)*


- The implications span ethics, science and policy design: One Health is used to motivate investing in vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics; aligning surveillance and data; and structuring co-funded partnerships (e.g., animal health and welfare) that, in principle, embed nonhuman interests in health decisions. (Sections 3.4.2; Cluster 1 gap analysis)

- It falls short of score 4 because while it names concrete instruments (HERA, AMR partnership) and priority domains, it does not detail binding governance arrangements that would institutionalise equal consideration of nonhuman health (e.g., dedicated representation, legal triggers) or explicit operational steps allocating authority across sectors.

#### IPBSVALUES22: Summary for policymakers of the methodological assessment of the diverse values and valuation of nature

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because One Health is presented with concrete mechanisms for collaboration (across UN bodies, cities, civil society), implementation examples, and explicit implications for aligning values and actions; it guides outcomes and criteria in the policy cycle but is not itself legislated here. - The assessment provides operational detail on One Health: actors, actions, and implementation: “The ‘One Health’ approach... aims to jointly achieve human, domestic and wild animal and environmental health across multiple levels of society... Collaborations between researchers, practitioners and indigenous peoples and local communities seek to integrate and share databases... co-develop (and co-learn from) good practices...” (Box SPM 7) - It identifies governance instruments and criteria: “National Governments and regional bodies are voluntarily setting up their own One Health strategies... identify preventive and therapeutic interventions to support livestock health, reduce disease transmission to people and enhance food safety.” (Box SPM 7) - It connects to values and leverage points (cross-sectoral capacities, co-learning): “Social learning facilitates embedding the values of nature in decision-making... co-learning across scales and sectors.” (D8) - It positions One Health within the policy cycle (agenda setting, design, adoption, monitoring): “Valuation can support policymaking across the different stages of the policy cycle...” (C2)

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### EURIGHTS: Towards an EU Charter of the Fundamental Rights of Nature

- **Organisation**: EESC
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because One Health is explicitly discussed and used conceptually to justify integrated human–ecosystem governance within the Charter’s legal framework, including implications for policy prioritization and institutional integration, but without a self-standing One Health policy instrument.

- One Health explicitly defined and linked to Charter goals: 

> In the face of the Covid 19 pandemic... we can see that human health and the health of the biosphere are not separate - they are interdependent.
>
> *(Executive Summary, p. 4)*


- Formal definition and application rationale: 

> ‘One Health is a collaborative, multisectoral, and transdisciplinary approach... with the goal of achieving optimal health outcomes recognizing the interconnection between people, animals, plants, and their shared environment’: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention...
>
> *(Section 3.2, p. 34)*


- Used to motivate prioritization of ecological interests: 

> We can conclude that this condition of vulnerability, shared by humans, non‑humans and nature, should justify the prevalence of the common interest of survival... This is also in line with the previously mentioned One Health approach.
>
> *(Section 3.2, p. 34-35)*


- Implications for outcomes and governance are articulated (but not as standalone policy): 

> The Charter... would lead scientific research towards the common good of sustainability... educational programs aimed at the diffusion of the new five pillars of the ecological conversion...
>
> *(Section 6.4.3, Cultural issues (C3)*

, p. 109)

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### EUCLIM24: Towards sustainable transformation: research priorities in climate change and biodiversity

- **Organisation**: EC
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because Planetary Health (within the One Health/Ecohealth family) is used as a central guiding lens, with definitions, linkages to IPCC/IPBES, and identification of research gaps and priorities across health, biodiversity, and climate, though it stops short of prescribing specific policy instruments. - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Planetary Health... ‘the health of human civilis ations and the natural systems on which they depend’ (Whitmee et. al. 2015)... Almost all the editions [10 New Insights] have highlighted the multiple impacts on physical and mental health of climate change... and the significance of co-benefits for human health of action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
>
> *(Section 1.1)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> It is imperative to take a systems approach to investigating the health of the planet, including all living and non-living, human and non-human... the one-ness of the planet - and the 'one nature' approach.
>
> *(Introduction)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> The links between climate and biodiversity are highly complex... a ‘nexus approach’ to governance... mainstreaming of biodiversity into climate policy and vice versa... to generate synergistic wins.
>
> *(Section 1.2)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Key Research Gaps: How will climate change and biodiversity loss affect health... What indicators are needed to track progress, including transboundary climate risks?
>
> *(Section 1.1 research gaps)*



---

#### STOCK50: Stockholm+50: unlocking a better future

- **Organisation**: SEI & CEEW
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because One Health is explicitly engaged as a conceptual/policy framework with a clear proposal to expand its scope from instrumental human benefit to recognizing animal health and welfare as ends in themselves—an important more-than-human reorientation with implications for governance and practice.

- Context/synthesis: The report calls for an expanded interpretation of One Health to include animal wellbeing intrinsically, shifting the framework away from narrow anthropocentrism. 

> Researchers, experts and policymakers should expand the interpretation of the One Health framework to recognize animal health and welfare as an end in itself, and not just instrumental to human health outcomes.
>
> *(Recommendations – Protect animal welfare by mainstreaming it in sustainable development governance)*


- Context/synthesis: This sits within a broader package (animal welfare impact assessments, subsidy reform) that sketches how One Health-aligned institutions would operationalize more-than-human welfare considerations. 

> Support policies that benefit humans and non-human animals alike... Animal welfare impact assessments can play a valuable role... phase down public subsidies for animal products... increase support for plant‑based food production...
>
> *(Recommendations – Protect animal welfare...)*

## Score 2: Theoretical Treatment

### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### EUANTHRO: Exiting the Anthropocene? Exploring fundamental change in our relationship with nature

- **Organisation**: EEA
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because One Health is cited to articulate coupled human–ecosystem health, informing the case for systemic governance change.

- Context/synthesis: “Human health, other species’ health and planetary health are intertwined (Meynen, 2021), an insight captured by the ‘one health’ concept (WHO, 2023).” (p.8)

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### EUSTI50: S&T&I for 2050: science, technology and innovation for ecosystem performance – accelerating sustainability transitions

- **Organisation**: EC DG R&I
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because planetary/One Health is invoked as a guiding framework to locate arenas of interaction and to support co‑shaping practices, but it is not developed into direct nonhuman decision‑making empowerment mechanisms.

- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> The notion of the planetary and human health, especially the EcoHealth concept, could also be placed in this group as it provides a guiding framework for locating some of the critical arenas of interaction of human and ecological system elements.
>
> *(2.2 Co‑shaping socio‑ecological systems)*


- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Precautionary and anticipatory approaches to technology and innovation governance have become better equipped to account for the complexity and uncertainty associated with socio‑technical change. Such governance approaches enable the design of more adaptable, resilient systems.

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### UNCITIES21: Global environment outlook for cities – towards green and just cities (GEO for Cities)

- **Organisation**: UNEP & UN-Habitat
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report explicitly calls for integrated treatment of human, animal and environmental health in the context of zoonoses and pandemics, discussing implications but without detailing a specific governance mechanism.

- Concept and implications: 

> Paying more attention to the integrated treatment of human, animal and environmental health can help prevent and reduce the risk of the development and spread of zoonotic diseases (UNEP 2020).
>
> *(Chapter 3, 3.5)*


- Contextualization to COVID-19: 

> Urban development, environmental degradation, climate change and increased demand for meat in diets are bringing humans and animals closer together in cities, facilitating the emergence of zoonotic diseases.
>
> *(Chapter 3, 3.5)*


- Link to practice: The framework is tied to urban planning responses (e.g., reducing habitat loss, nature-based buffers) in the multispecies and resilience dimensions. (Chapter 4, 4.2.3; Chapter 5, 5.4)

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### SCTRANSS25: Environment strategy for Scotland – transformative changes for sustainability

- **Organisation**: Scottish Government
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because One Health/EcoHealth/Planetary Health are mentioned in a list of sectoral tools without further development in this report.

- The report lists health frameworks among sectoral interventions but does not elaborate mechanisms within its own recommendations: 

> Health – Planetary health approaches (IO, NSG) • One health approaches (IO, NSG) • EcoHealth approaches (IO, NSG) • Community health approaches (IO, NSG).
>
> *(Table 2: Sectoral and Cross-Sectoral Interventions)*


- The main body focuses on economic, legal, and participatory levers rather than detailing One Health implementation: 

> Specific policy levers which can contribute to these broader transformative shifts include economic and financial measures... legal pathways, socio-cultural approaches...
>
> *(Executive Summary)*
