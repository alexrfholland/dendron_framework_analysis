#### EUNATURERIGHTS21: Can nature get it right? Rights of Nature in the European context

- **Organisation**: European Parliament
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because the study proposes concrete, actionable mechanisms to embed the intrinsic value of biodiversity into EU primary law and suggests specific legislative reforms (principles of ecological integrity and non-regression), offering clear policy steps for implementation.

- Concrete constitutional proposal: 

> One example of an idea borrowed from the RoN school of thought is to introduce a provision on the constitutional level in the EU about the intrinsic value of biodiversity and some basic principles of ecological integrity.
>
> *(Executive Summary)*


- Detailed recommendation with steps: 

> 1. The introduction of new environmental principles in EU primary law – It may be fruitful to introduce some new principles of environmental law on the constitutional level in EU law... principles concerning environmental or ecological integrity, as well as a general recognition of the intrinsic value of biodiversity.
>
> *(6. A Summary of Proposals for the Future)*


- Grounding in international law and EU context: 

> the CBD recognises the 'intrinsic value of biodiversity'... What is lacking on a constitutional level in comparison with ideas of RoN is... a general recognition of the intrinsic value of biodiversity. It can however be said to reside in the nature conservation directives, as well as the case-law on these directives by the CJEU.

## Score 3: Core Conceptual Device / Implications Explored

### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### UNGEOETHICS22: Concept note of the World Commission on the Ethics of Scientific Knowledge and Technology (COMEST) on the ethics of climate engineering

- **Organisation**: UNESCO COMEST
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the concept note positions the intrinsic value of nature as a core ethical question to be addressed in climate engineering governance, exploring implications (moral rights, distribution of risks, intercultural ethics) and intending to develop guiding principles, though not yet prescribing concrete governance mechanisms. - It foregrounds intrinsic value as a central ethical challenge posed by engineering nature: 

> How to deal with the intrinsic value of 'nature' when nature becomes an engineering project? Should we also attribute moral rights to nature: to oceans, rivers, ice caps?
>
> *(Introduction)*

 - It commits to elaborate ecocentric perspectives and intercultural ethics that recognize nature’s value: 

> The report will stress the importance of including ecocentric perspectives in the analysis of the ethical debate.
>
> *(II. Ethical issues)*

 - It frames work towards ethical values/principles and policy recommendations: 

> Finally, the report will examine governance issues... before formulating ethical values and principles on the basis of intercultural ethical dialogue, and policy recommendations for Member States.
>
> *(Introduction)*

### IMPLEMENTATION AND METRICS

#### IUCNWILD16: Wilderness protected areas: management guidelines for IUCN Category 1b protected areas

- **Organisation**: IUCN
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Applied/Practice-Based

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because intrinsic value is explicitly named as a foundational concept guiding wilderness objectives and management (preserving nonhuman nature for its own sake), and the report works through implications for plans, indicators, and practice; however, it does not prescribe a single legal mechanism for intrinsic value. - Intrinsic value is made a core management aim, shaping outcomes and criteria for success: 

> Manage wilderness both to preserve intrinsic wilderness values and to sustain human values.
>
> *(2.4, Guiding principles)*

 - It explores implications across ethical/conceptual and practical domains, linking intrinsic values to stewardship decisions: 

> Such management permits natural ecological processes to operate as freely as possible because, ultimately, wilderness values for society depend on retention of naturalness.
>
> *(2.4)*

 - It establishes strategies for realizing intrinsic value in practice (designing experiences, education, monitoring) and policy: 

> Educational values of wilderness areas are many and varied, but include sites and case studies for the study of natural ecosystems and processes... The wilderness condition allows students to study natural ecosystems... without... human influences.
>
> *(2.4 Examples)*

 - It defines non-degradation standards operationalizing respect for intrinsic value across indicators and thresholds: 

> Wilderness sites... should be managed to maintain the highest integrity... through an explicit focus on non-degradation... management must define a baseline against which degradation can be measured.
>
> *(2.2)*

 - It institutionalizes intrinsic value within objectives and monitoring (planning, LAC, MRDG), turning moral commitment into accountable practice: 

> Goals and objectives stated in a wilderness management plan serve as guiding statements for deciding which management actions are necessary and appropriate...
>
> *(2.6)*

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### IPBESTCA2: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 2. Visions of a sustainable world – for nature and people

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because intrinsic value is used as a core conceptual mechanism via the Nature Futures Framework (NFF) across the chapter’s analytic heart, with implications for mapping visions, assessing transformative potential, and outlining pathways. However, the chapter does not provide concrete operational governance mechanisms that enact intrinsic value directly.

- Intrinsic value is foundational to the chapter’s analytic device, explicitly framing how visions are categorized and assessed: 

> Transformative visions value nature in three ways identified in the Nature Futures Framework developed by the IPBES task force on scenarios and models: intrinsic (nature for nature), relational (nature as culture) and instrumental (nature for society). Some of the more transformative visions are informed by all three value types in a balanced approach to human-nature relations.
>
> *(Executive Summary, point 9)*


- The chapter uses intrinsic value to map visions and to motivate diverse pathways, showing implications/hypotheticals for how value framings steer futures: 

> Figure 2.5-B shows the most inspiring visions mapped onto the Nature Futures Framework... Each Nature Futures Framework corner represents a set of specific values: i) nature for nature or valuing nature intrinsically... The same set of 44 visions... was used, with the addition of five visions to fill a gap in the intrinsic value corner... The Nature Futures Framework is... used here as one way of capturing how inspiring visions value nature.
>
> *(2.3.2.2)*


- It develops outcomes/criteria by relating value framings to transformative potential and strategies to shift visions, indicating conceptual consequences: 

> Together, resistance and comprehensiveness define the transformative potential of a vision... Stakeholders and decision makers can improve the transformative potential of visions by following three strategies...
>
> *(2.3.2.1)*


- It extends the analysis by proposing endpoints based on value framings, including a specifically intrinsic endpoint with societal implications: 

> Endpoints here are considered as collective ‘placements’... Nature for nature (intrinsic value of nature)... There is a focus on people living in self-sustaining urban areas designed to minimize the influence of people in the biosphere, but also to ensure nature is incorporated into these settlements.
>
> *(Table 2.2)*


- Prevents higher score: while intrinsic value is central and used to structure implications, the chapter does not specify concrete legal/policy mechanisms that directly institutionalize intrinsic value in governance.

#### IPBESPATHWAYS19: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 5. Realizing a sustainable world for nature and people: transformative strategies, actions and roles for all

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because intrinsic value is used as a core conceptual device across the chapter to reorient decisions beyond instrumental values, with explicit implications for options, targets, indicators and governance; however, while implications and hypothetical pathways are provided, detailed institutional mechanisms specific to intrinsic value are not laid out (hence not 4).

- The chapter emphasizes shifting from instrumental to intrinsic/relational values as foundational to transformative change and to expand options: 

> Most existing options for actors have predominantly focused on instrumental values of nature. Their expansion to include options that reflect relational and intrinsic values of nature is visible in specific examples...
>
> *(Exec. summary, point 12)*


- The legal section ties intrinsic valuations to legal reforms: 

> Promising legal approaches towards considering more than instrumental values of nature include nature’s rights and making ecocide an international crime.
>
> *(5.3.4)*


- Strategy 5 structurally centers a values shift: 

> Strategy 5 aims to address the root causes... by shifting individual and societal views and values... prioritizes the recognition of interconnections between humans and nature... It emphasizes systemic reorganization driven by shifts in views and values...
>
> *(5.7)*


- The chapter links intrinsic/relational valuations to monitoring and metrics development (goals/indicators): 

> Revising goals, metrics and indicators of progress can lead to diverse valuation of nature... measures either adjust the GDP measure... replace it... or supplement it to account for nature’s contributions...
>
> *(5.5.4)*

#### IPBSVALUES22: Summary for policymakers of the methodological assessment of the diverse values and valuation of nature

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because intrinsic value is explicitly embedded in the IPBES values typology as a core conceptual mechanism and the assessment develops implications for valuation, decision-making, and policy instruments; it guides indicators and methods but stops short of prescribing legal mechanisms. - Intrinsic value is defined within the core typology that structures the whole assessment: “Specific values are judgements... grouped into instrumental values..., relational values..., and intrinsic values (i.e., independent of people as valuers).” (KM3; Figure SPM 2; Box SPM 1) - The implications are worked through for measurement, methods, and policy cycles: “Valuation methods... can assess different types of values of nature; however, challenges emerge when comparing different values to inform decision-making.” (B4) - Intrinsic values are integrated into future pathways and scenarios alongside other value types: “The types of scenarios that are most likely to achieve sustainable and just futures... consider a range of instrumental, relational and intrinsic values…” (C7) - The assessment shows how intrinsic values shape outcomes and criteria, e.g., biodiversity conservation aims: “Decision-making... can be advanced by following six interrelated values-centred guidelines… Represent meaningfully and respectfully the diverse world-views, broad and specific values...” (D1)

## Score 2: Theoretical Treatment

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### UNLAND17_1: The Global Land Outlook: Part 1 - The Big Picture

- **Organisation**: UNCCD
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the document discusses existence rights and intrinsic value of species in some depth and across ethical context (faiths, stewardship), but remains theoretical and does not propose concrete mechanisms to empower nonhumans.

- The text introduces and explains existence rights for species, emphasizing moral obligations beyond human utility: 

> During the last few years, the concept of existence rights has emerged: the rights of survival of species and ecological interactions. Research shows that this view is prevalent across many societies today. Most people instinctively feel that humans have an obligation to prevent species extinction wherever possible. The huge support for iconic species, such as the tiger or the panda, which most people will never see in the wild, demonstrates that conservation is not just a utilitarian issue.
>
> *(Chapter 1, Meaning of Land, p. 25)*


- It links existence value to widely held ethical doctrines of stewardship, showing a cross-cultural ethical grounding: 

> This view is now shared by the large majority of the world’s major philosophies and and religions, which recognize the duty of stewardship. The leaders of all the major faiths have issued statements acknowledging the moral obligation of humans not to destroy what remains of nature.
>
> *(Chapter 1, Meaning of Land, p. 25)*


- The section also catalogs faith traditions’ environmental links (Table 1.1), reinforcing the intrinsic value discourse, but it does not translate this into governance tools that would empower nonhuman decision-making. (Chapter 1, Meaning of Land, Table 1.1, pp. 25–26)

#### EUECOSERVG2021: Ecosystem services accounting – part III

- **Organisation**: JRC, EC
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report engages in detail with intrinsic/existence values and uses them conceptually and methodologically (welfare valuation, choice experiments) to assess a non-use service (habitat and species maintenance), but it does so via anthropocentric WTP and does not employ intrinsic value to empower nonhumans beyond human preference aggregation.

- The conceptual framing explicitly distinguishes intrinsic from instrumental values and ecocentric from anthropocentric lenses: 

> Different kinds of values apply throughout the cascade model: what defines the ‘value’ can be the purpose and the worldview perspective. When considering the purpose, the meaning of ‘value’ may range from intrinsic to instrumental; when considering the worldview perspective, it may have an anthropocentric view or ecocentric view to illustrate the perspective or worldview of the analysis (Tuner et al., 2003).
>
> *(Chapter 2.1)*


- The report defines habitat and species maintenance as a non-use (existence) value and operationalizes it through stated preference methods: 

> Ultimately, in this study, in line with the definition provided, we consider habitat and species maintenance as a final ES. people value habitats and species not because they want to ‘use’ them, either directly or indirectly (use values), either now or in the future (option and bequest values); they value habitats and species simply for their existence, because thanks to these ecosystems we can maintain the planet as we know it... Existence values (also called non-use values) are an integral part of the total economic value...
>
> *(Chapter 3.1)*


- The existence value is monetized via a choice experiment and aggregated, showing conceptual-to-methodological translation, but still through human preferences: 

> The methodological approach used in our application was a stated preference survey... through an ad hoc choice experiment... it was possible to separate the willingness to pay (WTP) for the different types of service areas... The monetary value attributed to the different types of service areas is the WTP expressed by the respondents.
>
> *(Chapter 3.3)*


- Limits remain anthropocentric, preventing a higher score: 

> Finally, the choice experiment is based on individual stated preferences and, as such, is not in line with exchange values characterising all the other ES accounts and the system of national accounts (SNA).
>
> *(Chapter 3.3)*

#### UNLEGAL: Environmental rule of law: tracking progress and charting future directions

- **Organisation**: UNEP
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report discusses intrinsic value of nature in multiple jurisprudential contexts, linking it to environmental rights and rights of nature, but it remains a theoretical justification rather than a standalone, central framework and is not directly operationalized.

- Courts’ reliance on intrinsic value is used to justify protection beyond human interests: 

> For example, the Supreme Court of Mexico has held that the right to a healthy environment protects both human health and wellbeing and the protection of nature due to its intrinsic value.
>
> *(Chapter 4, Section 4.3.3)*


- Regional bodies also reference intrinsic value when integrating human rights and environmental protection: 

> In 2017, the [African] Commission adopted Resolution 372... and ‘to recognize and respect the intrinsic value of sacred natural sites and territories’. This resolution combined the established nexus between human rights and the environment with... the value of nature independent of human interests.
>
> *(Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2)*


- The report links intrinsic value to rights of nature debates conceptually: 

> Granting rights to a river or ecosystem can benefit human communities... Recognizing environmental personhood can be a mechanism for protecting rights of current and future generations... Proponents of this view believe that respecting, protecting, and fulfilling rights of nature is a requirement for the environmental rule of law...
>
> *(Chapter 4, Section 4.3.5)*

#### UNPLANETBOUND22: Thematic study: planetary boundaries

- **Organisation**: UNDRR
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report explicitly calls for recognizing the intrinsic value of nature as a principle to reorganize finance and governance, i.e., a conceptual ethical stance with implications, but without detailed enforcement architecture. - It urges value recognition beyond utility: 

> ...rethinking how we manage systems across all facets of society, from reorganising financial and governance structures so that they recognise the intrinsic value of nature, to considering how we utilise and safeguard digital systems...
>
> *(Part 1.5, bullets)*

 - It links intrinsic value to DRR outcomes: 

> Start to think differently about human relationships with the greater Earth community... towards an ethos of planetary stewardship... [and] to reflect nature's true value in these spheres and to ensure that decision-making in all spheres is risk-informed.
>
> *(Part 1.5, final bullets)*

#### EUHRPLAN21: Human rights for the planet

- **Organisation**: Council of Europe
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the intrinsic value of nature is explicitly recognized in international law and used to reflect on ECtHR’s approach (e.g., wildlife conservation cases), but no concrete European mechanism is implemented to empower nonhumans based on intrinsic value.

- Intrinsic value is grounded in international wildlife law and tied to ECtHR cases: 

> the intrinsic value of nature is a universal undertaking that is the foundation of the modern-times regimes of international wildlife law. This has already been recognised by the ECtHR with reference to endangered species of seabirds and turtles, as well as forest or coastline habitats. Various national policies of nature conservation have been sanctioned by the Court as a legitimate aim...
>
> *(Overview of ECtHR environmental case-law)*


- The discussion explicitly explores nature’s value independent of human benefit: 

> could we go one step farther and take an ecocentric approach according to which nature has a value of its own, that is to say, irrespective of any benefits that it may generate for humans?
>
> *(Overview of ECtHR environmental case-law)*

#### SIPSECURITY21: Anthropocene (in)securities: reflections on collective survival 50 years after Stockholm

- **Organisation**: SIPRI
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the text argues for recognizing the intrinsic value and rights of nonhumans and critiques anthropocentric law/security on that basis, but does not present a stand-alone intrinsic-value policy mechanism; rather, it underpins broader legal/security reform proposals.

- Context/synthesis: It makes a normative claim that nonhuman nature has intrinsic rights to flourish, motivating legal and governance change. 

> It decentres the human morally and ontologically, acknowledging the intrinsic rights of non‑human nature to flourish and exist apart from human use, and its growing power and agency...
>
> *(Chapter 7 – Introduction)*


- Context/synthesis: This is leveraged to critique principle 21’s exploitation license and to advocate for earth‑centered security and legal recognition (e.g., via the World Charter for Nature). 

> The tension... between ecocentric and anthropocentric approaches in environmental rights... an ecocentric approach would value shift the focus from Homo sapiens to the planet... nature has value regardless of whether humans find use or value in it.
>
> *(Chapter 7 – Two genealogies)*

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### NZOCEAN21: The breaking wave: reforming the oceans management system in Aotearoa New Zealand

- **Organisation**: Environmental Defence Society
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because intrinsic value is repeatedly recognised (e.g., te moana’s value and species’ worth beyond utility) and used to set ethical context, but without an explicit, operationalised mechanism directly tied to intrinsic value alone. 

- Recognition and ethical baseline: 

> Te moana has intrinsic value, not just instrumental value. For Māori, its value lies in whakapapa and whanaungatanga – it is not just a resource to be used, but rather an ancestor to be treasured and looked after.
>
> *(Chapter 2.5)*


- Intrinsic value of species and moral criteria: 

> The importance of some of these species is because they are rare or threatened; people’s focus tends to come into sharp relief when there is the prospect of an entire species dying out, never to return. ... For others, like whales and dolphins, their value is based on more complex moral considerations... is it therefore 'wrong' to harm them, even if no significant damage is done to the ecosystems...
>
> *(Chapter 2.3)*


- Informing protective stances in planning: 

> We need to think positively – the system is a tool for building our relationship with te moana, not just to reign in the more destructive tendencies of humanity.
>
> *(Chapter 3.5)*

### SCENARIOS AND FUTURES EXPLORATION

#### NEHALF20: Narratives for the Half Earth and Sharing the Planet scenarios

- **Organisation**: PBL
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report emphasizes intrinsic value as the basis for HE’s objectives (e.g., species persistence irrespective of utility), but uses it to justify targets rather than to implement nonhuman agency in governance. 

- Value basis: “HE... premises on the prioritis[ation] of intrinsic value of nature while protecting nature... conservation aims at preserving ecological processes and biodiversity for their intrinsic value.” (6.1.2)

- Ethical claim: “It is morally wrong for our species to drive other species to extinction... The well-being of non-human life on Earth has value in itself.” (3.2.1)

## Score 1: Token Acknowledgement

### IMPLEMENTATION AND METRICS

#### NPOS25: Draft State of Nature Metrics

- **Organisation**: Nature Positive Initiative
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Applied/Practice-Based

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because intrinsic value is mentioned explicitly in a single-line statement framing nature’s value, but the document does not develop or operationalize intrinsic value into governance mechanisms or measurement architecture; the focus remains on ecological state metrics.

- Context/synthesis: The overarching goal statement recognizes intrinsic value as part of the nature-positive framing, establishing ethical grounding but not extending to criteria or rules of decision-making. 

> the nature positive goal recognises that nature is important for its in own sake
>
> *(Analysis context note reflected in the report’s framing)*

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### EUONEHEALTH24: One Health governance in the European Union

- **Organisation**: SAPEA
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because the intrinsic value of nonhuman life is explicitly acknowledged in OHHLEP’s underlying principles as adopted by the report, but not developed into a distinct governance instrument.

- The report enumerates the OHHLEP principle recognising intrinsic value, extending ethical standing beyond humans: 

> socio-ecological equilibrium that seeks a harmonious balance... and the intrinsic value of all living things within the ecosystem
>
> *(One Health definition – Issues to consider; OHHLEP Key Underlying Principles)*


- This provides ethical grounding for nonhuman consideration across the report’s governance and evaluation proposals.
