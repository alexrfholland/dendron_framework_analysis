## Score 4: Actionable Mechanisms

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### ICNATUREPOS24: Blueprint for a Nature-Positive Adelaide

- **Organisation**: Interdisciplinary Conservation Science Group
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because the report defines the novel ecosystems framework, argues when and how to strategically embrace novelty to empower biodiversity in cities, and provides concrete rules, trade-off management and maintenance approaches, with case evidence and risk mitigation, making this a practical management framework.

- The framework is explicitly defined and contextualized for cities: 

> A novel ecosystem is a functioning ecosystem comprised of an arrangement of species that has no historical analogue... They are modified natural systems that have crossed irreversible socio-ecological thresholds due to human-induced environmental change (Hobbs et al. 2013). In theory, novel ecosystems are distinguished from designed or engineered ecosystems...
>
> *(Key concepts and definitions)*


- The report develops actionable guidance on when to use novelty, how to prioritize indigenous elements, and structural diversity: 

> Embrace novelty but use it strategically... Where native or locally native species are not suitable... consider non-local or exotic species... Maintain representation of indigenous plants... Enhance vegetation structure and diversity.
>
> *(Section 4.2.3 Design to achieve biodiversity objectives)*


- It devotes a lessons-learned section to using novelty to improve outcomes, with explicit trade-offs and management: 

> Unique environments and novel trade-offs – using novelty to improve outcomes... Several case studies have used novelty in different ways to enhance the biodiversity outcomes... For example, while use of locally native plant species is ideal, many native animals are capable of utilising plants that are native to larger geographic areas... Novel approaches to maintenance are also required... the use of heavy mulching and dense planting techniques can suppress weeds...
>
> *(Section 6.5)*


- It discusses risks and prudence in species selection, reflecting consequences and safeguards: 

> When considering novel plantings, it is important to recognise that there can be risk associated with some species performing too well and having unexpected environmental and/or management impact. As a result, the prudent evaluation of species can be a very beneficial process to begin with.
>
> *(Section 6.5)*


- Case applications demonstrate the framework in practice (e.g., The Meadow streetscape, Glenelg WWTP, SA Water plant palettes), with maintenance innovations and ecosystem function considerations: 

> A demonstration site for use of locally native coastal plant species... A management technique of utilising ‘living mulch’ protects the soil from erosion while minimising the need for pesticides...

 and 

> This project aimed to create a completely novel ecosystem which has resulted in associated design and maintenance challenges...

## Score 3: Core Conceptual Device / Implications Explored

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### EUINVASIVE24: IPBES Invasive Alien Species Assessment: Chapter 1. Introducing Biological Invasions and the IPBES Thematic Assessment of Invasive Alien Species and Their Control

- **Organisation**: Roy
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because novel ecosystems are extensively discussed to conceptualize IAS-driven system change, management implications, trade-offs, and governance cautions; it considers adaptive governance, nature-based solutions, and thresholds, but does not provide prescriptive policy protocols in this chapter.

- Context/synthesis: The chapter details how IAS contribute to novel ecosystems and the consequences for biodiversity and function. “Changes in the composition of communities as a consequence of invasive alien species will lead the emergence of new species combinations... termed ‘novel ecosystems’ or ‘emerging ecosystems’... hybridization... species declines... or ecosystem-level change (e.g., changes in nutrient cycles, fire cycles or hydrology).” (Box 1.5)

- Context/synthesis: It explores management implications, including reversibility thresholds, risks of invasional meltdown, and context-specific adaptive governance. “Perceptions depend on many factors... reversal of the novel state... viewed as a useful... goal... On the other side... the transition... is viewed as irreversible when a system has crossed an ecosystem restoration threshold... it is desirable to adopt a cautious and context-specific approach… including the potential role of novel ecosystems as nature-based solutions... This uncertainty also highlights the value of pragmatism when recommending management strategies...” (Box 1.5)

- Context/synthesis: It connects to future-oriented goals and criteria (e.g., multifunctionality, governance fit) to assess desirability and success. “Acknowledging the uncertainty of outcomes... and the potential for invasional meltdown... it is desirable to adopt a cautious and context-specific approach... including the potential role of novel ecosystems as nature-based solutions to mitigating other drivers of change in nature.” (Box 1.5)

## Score 2: Theoretical Treatment

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### UNLAND17_2: The Global Land Outlook: Part 2 - The Outlook

- **Organisation**: UNCCD
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report explicitly invokes the 'novel and hybrid ecosystems' concept to frame restoration realism and forward-looking planning, but stops at conceptual guidance and does not propose governance standards or procedures to institutionalize novel ecosystems in practice.

- Defines emergence of novel/hybrid systems and challenges historical baselines, recommending adaptive restoration: 

> Extensive ecosystem modification, in combination with rapid global change, will likely lead to the emergence of novel and hybrid ecosystems, especially in landscapes that have undergone higher degrees of degradation and are therefore less resilient to rapid change. As a consequence, it may be unrealistic to attempt to restore landscapes to a desired pre-disturbance state; in addition, there may be no appropriate reference ecosystem to guide restoration.
>
> *(Chapter 9, Restoration)*


- Encourages considering future trajectories rather than past states (conceptual implications of novel ecosystems): 

> Restoration will need to consider future trajectories of climate, land use, demographic and socio-economic change, and species range shifts. For example, seeds sourced for restoration should be drawn from species suitable to modeled future climates at the restoration site, combined with seeds of local provenance.
>
> *(Chapter 9, Restoration)*

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### EURIGHTS: Towards an EU Charter of the Fundamental Rights of Nature

- **Organisation**: EESC
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the document discusses novel ecosystems conceptually to reframe conservation and management challenges, but it does not provide dedicated, concrete management mechanisms under a 'novel ecosystems' program.

- Conceptualization and implications: 

> In legal traditions different from Western ones... It is correct to speak of 'Novel Ecosystems': they are new ecosystems produced by human intervention.
>
> *(Section 6.1, p. 88)*


- Use to set out challenges of legal adaptation: 

> Ecology has shown that this idea of Nature is illusory and misleading... All biomes on Earth are 'anthropogenic biomes'... This means that Nature and humans cannot be separated.
>
> *(Section 6.1, p. 88-89)*
