### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### EUANTHRO: Exiting the Anthropocene? Exploring fundamental change in our relationship with nature

- **Organisation**: EEA
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the ‘Capitalocene’ is explicitly referenced to analyze the structural roots of ecological crises and injustice (appropriation, commodification), informing the need for paradigm change.

- Context/synthesis: “The history of Western countries is characterised by colonisation, appropriation and commodification (Moore, 2017, 2018).” (p.3)

- Context/synthesis: It leverages this critique to argue for deep transformations beyond weak sustainability and consumerism (p.5–6, p.13).

### SCENARIOS AND FUTURES EXPLORATION

#### NEHALF20: Narratives for the Half Earth and Sharing the Planet scenarios

- **Organisation**: PBL
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report explicitly employs the Capitalocene concept to frame structural drivers of biodiversity loss and conservation politics in SP, but uses it to set context rather than as an operational governance framework within the document. 

- Framing of systemic drivers: “it is increasingly acknowledged... we are living in the so-called ‘Capitalocene’. Capitalocene means that ‘a pervasive human influence over non-human systems can be seen... [and] has been most centrally produced by the globalisation of capitalist production’.” (3.2.2)

- Link to conservation political economy: “the development of capitalism premises on the manipulation of nature... conservation practice has worked as a means of capitalist expansion whereby nature becomes reduced to ‘resources’ or ‘assets’.” (3.2.2)

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### EIVIS23: Exploring new visions for a sustainable bioeconomy

- **Organisation**: JRC, EC
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because Capitalocene is mentioned in passing in references and thematic framing rather than developed in the main argument. - Context/synthesis: The report cites Patel and Moore’s work to situate systemic extractivism and colonial logics underlying socio-ecological crises. 

> These interrelated crises... are structural or systemic crises, since the individuals and communities lifestyles and actions for change are conditioned and limited by the system that promotes consumerism and capital accumulation.
>
> *(p. 36)*


- Context/synthesis: However, there is no dedicated section operationalizing Capitalocene as a framework for governance redesign; it serves as contextual critique.
