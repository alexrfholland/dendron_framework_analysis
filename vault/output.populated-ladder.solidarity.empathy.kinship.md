# Kinship/Indigenous perspectives, Ubuntu

## Score 4: Actionable Mechanisms

*No sources at this score level*

## Score 3: Core Conceptual Device / Implications Explored

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### NZOCEAN21: The breaking wave: reforming the oceans management system in Aotearoa New Zealand

- **Organisation**: Environmental Defence Society
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because kinship is explicitly central (whakapapa, whanaungatanga, kaitiakitanga), used to guide institutional and policy design (e.g., co-governance, transfer of powers, tikanga-aligned rāhui), and to shape outcomes, indicators, and governance arrangements across ethical, technical, and political contexts. 

- Foundational mechanism: 

> Te ao Māori offers a particular way of seeing te moana and its whakapapa relationships with humans. ... Te moana (through deities) is an ancestor, linked through oral tradition and whakapapa (kinship) to the people that use and protect it.
>
> *(Chapter 2.2)*


- Policy and institutional implications: 

> Te ao Māori and tikanga Māori are not just 'subjects' of the oceans management system to be protected within that system. They also need to be factors that guide what the system looks like and the design choices made across all themes.
>
> *(Chapter 1.11)*


- Governance and decision criteria: 

> Māori need to retain their distinct identity in a future system as much as the system needs to reflect Māori values and aspirations... what a shared governance approach for the oceans might look like: one that makes room for tikanga.
>
> *(Chapter 1.11)*


- Methods and tools based on kinship values: 

> Rāhui is a Māori concept and cultural practice... A permanent rāhui may be imposed... A rāhui is carried out to pay respect to the area and to the people who may have been affected by the problem as a result.
>
> *(Chapter 5.2/5.6 Rāhui spotlight)*

## Score 2: Theoretical Treatment

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### IPBESTCA2: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 2. Visions of a sustainable world – for nature and people

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because kinship is explicitly framed as a worldview guiding holistic visions and stewardship, with Ubuntu cited; yet it is presented conceptually rather than as a formalized framework with institutional mechanisms here.

- Kinship worldview is central to Indigenous visions: 

> Visions consistently emphasize the need to address nature as an interconnected yet inseparable part of life... as part of a kinship worldview that comprises an intelligent and living nature.
>
> *(Box 2.3, Holistic approaches)*


- The value endpoint explicitly mentions Ubuntu and relational values: 

> Nature as culture (relational value of nature)... Values of reciprocity, stewardship and harmony structure people’s relationships with nature at all levels, including concepts like ubuntu.
>
> *(Table 2.2)*


- Prevents higher score: discussed as values and guiding concepts, without concrete institutionalization details in this chapter.

#### IPBESPATHWAYS19: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 5. Realizing a sustainable world for nature and people: transformative strategies, actions and roles for all

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because kinship/Ubuntu are explicitly referenced to reframe human–nonhuman relations and guide cultural shifts, but the chapter presents them primarily as conceptual orientations and examples rather than laying out institutional schemes.

- The chapter explicitly acknowledges kinship with nonhumans: 

> recognizing the agency and labour of plants and animals and their role as spiritual beings and kin, as in many Indigenous philosophies (Abbott, 2021; Barrett et al., 2017; Country et al., 2016).
>
> *(5.7.1)*


- Ubuntu and other relational philosophies are cataloged as ways to organize human–nature relations and values: Table 5.3 lists 

> Ubuntu... focuses on reciprocity, dialogue and collective humanity, which are extended to nature and have been applied in development, external relations, educational and health practices.
>
> *(Table 5.3; 5.7.1)*

## Score 1: Token Acknowledgement

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### IPBESTCA4: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 4. Overcoming the challenges of achieving transformative change

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because Ubuntu and related Indigenous worldviews are cited as examples in a figure to illustrate alternative relations between people and nature, but they are not further developed or operationalized in the chapter. - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Examples of diverse world views  representing relations between  people and nature  (IPBES 2022 Values Assessment)  ... [Figure lists examples including UBUNTU among others] ... This world view does not erase alternative world views, but it renders them illegitimate or  unimportant in the context of addressing biodiversity.
>
> *(Figure 4.3 caption/content)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> While the world is marked by diverse ways of knowing and living with nature, a prevailing world view that is based on persistent relations of domination forged in the colonial era obscures these alternatives and their transformative potential.
>
> *(Figure 4.3 legend)*
