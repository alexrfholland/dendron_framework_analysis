## Score 4: Actionable Mechanisms

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### EURIGHTS: Towards an EU Charter of the Fundamental Rights of Nature

- **Organisation**: EESC
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because Earth Jurisprudence is presented as the core theoretical and practical framework ('ecological mandate') and is operationalized into legal rules, institutions, and EU legislative proposals for implementation.

- Earth Jurisprudence is explicitly the theoretical backbone converted into legal mechanisms: 

> It goes on to set out the holistic and integrated principles of Earth Jurisprudence that have been endorsed by the UN through their ‘Harmony with Nature’ Programme, transforming them into a legal ‘ecological mandate’, as the backbone of the Charter.
>
> *(Executive Summary, p. 7)*


- The study defines the ecological mandate (how to implement EJ): 

> The 3 elements of the ecological mandate are: 1) the introduction of the substantive rights of nature; 2) the identification of new rules and methods of interpretation and application of the Law; 3) the introduction of the obligation to take into consideration the Rights of Nature in all EU policies, and not only in the decisions of the courts.
>
> *(Executive Summary, p. 7; Section 2.1, p. 16)*


- EJ principles are translated into actionable policy methods and governance criteria: 

> The legal recognition of Rights of Nature requires a holistic and ecologically-based approach to law that is underpinned by the following key principles of Earth Jurisprudence: 1) Wholeness... 2) Lawfulness... 3) Duty of Care, Prevention and Protection... 4) Rights of Nature... 5) Mutual Enhancement... 6) Resilience.
>
> *(Section 4.2, p. 51-52)*


- EJ is used to develop negotiation strategies and indicators (nested rights, hierarchy, SDGs/PBs mapping): 

> This establishes the basis for policies integrating Rights of Nature, Human rights and Economic rights... Operationalizing the planetary boundaries and Sustainable Development Goals at Member State levels, and identifying gaps, would form the basis of the implementation of the Rights of Nature framework.
>
> *(Section 5.3, p. 66)*


- EJ is connected to legal pathways in the EU: 

> If the EU adopts a Rights of Nature legal framework within an ecological legal context, it will herald the start of a new era, bringing law up to date with modern science... The Charter will offer the EU a great opportunity to take leadership...
>
> *(Section 5.4, p. 67-69)*

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### EUHRPLAN21: Human rights for the planet

- **Organisation**: Council of Europe
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because Earth Jurisprudence is explicitly identified as an emerging concept associated with rights of nature in the Americas, providing conceptual context, but it is not adopted or operationalized in European mechanisms in this document.

- Framing Earth Jurisprudence as part of a continental legal shift: 

> This ecocentric tendency toward the protection of the environment has spread throughout the Americas, not only in its recognition of the right to a healthy environment, but also in its recognition of the rights of nature and the emerging concept of Earth Jurisprudence.
>
> *(Inter-American approaches)*


- Linking jurisprudence to practice and remedies: 

> it is crucial that the Court order Comprehensive or Integral Reparations for environmental damages, especially through ecological restoration as a means of rehabilitation and restitution. I believe that this can be possible through a re-interpretation of the concept of 'just satisfaction' under Article 41 in relation to Article 46 of the European Convention.

#### EUNATURERIGHTS21: Can nature get it right? Rights of Nature in the European context

- **Organisation**: European Parliament
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because Earth jurisprudence/Earth system law is presented as part of the RoN intellectual lineage, and its tenets are analyzed for compatibility; the study does not advocate adopting Earth jurisprudence in the EU, but selectively imports principles (intrinsic value, ecological integrity).

- Explaining Earth jurisprudence and Earth system law: 

> His successors have developed these ideas into 'Earth System Law' or 'Earth Jurisprudence', broadening the universe of entities capable of qualifying as legal subjects... Theories... are not only concerned with defining nature’s rights, but also redefining the duties of humankind.
>
> *(2.2 Rights of Nature in legal philosophy)*


- Critical integration approach: 

> the RoN school of thought contains fresh insights... presents ideas that can be developed within our conventional legal notions... introduce a provision on the constitutional level in the EU about the intrinsic value of biodiversity and some basic principles of ecological integrity.
>
> *(5.7; Executive Summary)*

#### EUONEHEALTH24: One Health governance in the European Union

- **Organisation**: SAPEA
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because Earth Jurisprudence is explicitly identified as a promising legal orientation for One Health in Europe, with implications for extending rights to nonhumans, but the report presents it as an option rather than a detailed, operational EU legal blueprint.

- The report explicitly calls out Earth jurisprudence as an alternative to anthropocentric legal frameworks with potential EU relevance: 

> There is potential for One Health (“earth”) jurisprudence, which recognises that legal frameworks need to extend beyond Western legal ideals to embed diverse cultural, Indigenous and philosophical perspectives. This may offer an alternative to traditionally anthropocentric legal frameworks, extending legal rights to natural, non-human and even non-sentient entities such as rivers.
>
> *(EU policies – Summary/Key findings; Legal right to One Health?)*


- It connects jurisprudential shifts to policy consequences in One Health governance and litigation strategies: 

> Litigation on the basis of the right to One Health (and specifically a healthy environment) may be a game-changer... offering new opportunities for access to justice and to protect against gaps in existing legislation...
>
> *(EU policies – Legal right to One Health?)*


- While describing impacts and needs (balancing rights of human, animal and non-sentient beings), it does not provide a concrete EU legislative pathway, keeping this at a conceptual/strategic level: 

> Attention will need to be paid to balancing these rights of human, animal, and non-sentient beings.
>
> *(EU policies – Summary/Key findings)*

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### SCTRANSS25: Environment strategy for Scotland – transformative changes for sustainability

- **Organisation**: Scottish Government
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because Earth Jurisprudence is discussed to frame the legal turn beyond anthropocentrism and is linked to related tools (RoN, wild law), but the detailed actionable steps provided in the report are primarily under RoN and personhood rather than Earth Jurisprudence as a distinct programme.

- The report positions Earth Jurisprudence conceptually among legal approaches to align human law with ecological principles: 

> These are interconnected concepts that share a common theme of redefining the relationship between humans and the natural world within a legal framework... Earth Jurisprudence is the legal philosophy emphasizing the need for human laws to be aligned with the natural laws and ecological principles that govern the Earth...
>
> *(7.2 Legal and regulatory policy instruments)*


- It links the approach to empowering nonhuman interests in courts and policies via allied mechanisms (RoN, wild law, ecocide): 

> They all seek to shift away from an anthropocentric perspective towards eco-centric ones... Rights of Nature and Wild Law address specific legal recognition and protection of nature’s rights. Ecocide is based on specifically addressing severe ecological harm...
>
> *(7.2)*


- While informative, the concrete instruments recommended and detailed in the report (guardianship, charters, courts) are articulated under RoN; Earth Jurisprudence is not separately specified with unique steps here. (7.2)
