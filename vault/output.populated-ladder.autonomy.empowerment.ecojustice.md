# Ecological, interspecies, planetary, multispecies justice

## Score 4: Actionable Mechanisms

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### UNCITIES21: Global environment outlook for cities – towards green and just cities (GEO for Cities)

- **Organisation**: UNEP & UN-Habitat
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because the report treats multispecies justice as foundational to its vision (a core dimension of transformation), and operationalizes it with concrete, actionable mechanisms (e.g., multispecies planning, biodiversity and disaster plans, recognition of nonhumans as citizens), linking ethical, empirical, technical and political implications to outcomes, goals and indicators across multiple chapters.

- Core dimension framing (ethical/political): The Summary for decision makers elevates multispecies justice to a core pillar of urban action, explicitly linking it to transformative pathways and outcomes: 

> With this vision, we identify three main areas of urban action – or urban dimensions – involving ... (3) social inclusion and multispecies justice as core areas for advancing sustainability. Together, these dimensions cut across ... multispecies interactions.
>
> *(Summary, pp. 10–11)*


- Concept to implications and solutions (ethical/technical): The report conceptualizes rights and representation for nonhumans, then spells out feasible planning and governance actions: 

> Finally, picture a city that recognizes and values its multispecies character... a city where 'those who control and plan cities [...] consider the more-than-human', acknowledging the intrinsic value of nature and the respect it demands. ... This may require exploring ways to give a voice in governance to non-humans... and developing regulatory strategies to protect plants and animals from harm.
>
> *(Chapter 4, 4.2.3 Inclusive and just cities)*


- Concrete mechanisms and plans (technical/governance): The report details actionable, multisector tools and indicators aligned to multispecies justice: 

> Multispecies and nature-positive strategies should advance along two simultaneous tracks: (1) Urban biodiversity plans and habitat designs... and (2) Multispecies disaster preparedness plans that recognize the vital role played by companion animals, domestic animals, urban wildlife and plants...
>
> *(Chapter 4, 4.2.3)*


- Criteria for success and outcomes (practice/policy): The report provides case-based goals, indicators and negotiation strategies (e.g., pollinator citizenship, bee highways, biodiversity corridors) to guide implementation and measure progress: 

> Curridabat’s innovative ‘Sweet City’ urban plan highlights the critical role of pollinators, which are recognized as official citizens of the city... Oslo’s bee highway is designed to provide pollinator pathways through the city... identifying 'precautionary zones' where wild bees may need additional protection in the future.

## Score 3: Core Conceptual Device / Implications Explored

### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### UNESCOEDU20: Learning to become with the world: education for future survival

- **Organisation**: Common Worlds/UNESCO
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Humanities/Ethics

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the paper explicitly reorients education around ecological justice as a core guiding purpose, explores its implications for more-than-human flourishing and pedagogy, and develops outcomes like curricular reframing and ethics of recuperation, but does not lay out concrete policy instruments for governance implementation. - The authors redefine justice beyond the human and make it the remit of education, directly linking it to living respectfully with a damaged planet: 

> Education’s new remit is to promote ecological justice by teaching the arts of living respectfully and responsibly on a damaged planet (Tsing et al., 2017) and learning how to survive well together (Haraway, 2016). Along with this ecological reframing of justice, we have radically reassessed education’s humanist knowledge traditions.
>
> *(Visionary declarations, 1)*

 - They connect ecological justice to more-than-human relations and interdependence, indicating implications for practice and outcomes: 

> To consolidate a more-than-human notion of justice and meet education’s new charter of learning how to survive well together (Haraway, 2016), we have sought out ecologically attuned alternatives that acknowledge the collective agency and interdependence of all earthly beings, entities, and forces.
>
> *(Visionary declarations, 1)*

 - Justice is tied to ethics and concrete pedagogical commitments (recuperation, mutual flourishing), showing criteria for success: 

> By letting go of the grandiose fantasies of humans saving the environment, we have now been able to focus on the much more modest goal of collaboratively attending to the mutual flourishing of all – human and more than human – and on recuperating our damaged common worlds together, even if only partial recuperation is possible.
>
> *(Visionary declarations, 7)*

 - The report outlines outcomes and negotiation strategies in education systems (curricula, pedagogies, teacher roles) that are anchored in ecological justice: 

> We have resituated the practice of education in common worlds because we no longer differentiate between the social and the environmental, and no longer frame pedagogy as an exclusively human activity. Motivated by a commitment to seeking intergenerational and multispecies justice on this damaged Earth... we have shifted the goal of education from a humanitarian charter to one of ecological justice.
>
> *(Visionary declarations, 7)*

#### COMESTWATER22: Report of COMEST on water ethics: ocean, freshwater and coastal areas

- **Organisation**: UNESCO COMEST
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the report extends environmental justice beyond humans to include other species and ecosystems, reflects on governance, recognition, and capabilities, and articulates implications for transboundary law and policy, though it does not present a dedicated multispecies justice statute. 

- Nonhuman inclusion: 

> Water justice demands that all living organisms and ecosystems should have access to safe water.
>
> *(VI.6 Justice)*


- Beyond distribution to participation and recognition: 

> various writers suggested that environmental justice should go beyond distribution, and include participation, recognition and capabilities.
>
> *(VI.6 Justice)*


- Intergenerational, interspecies dimensions are explicit: 

> Water justice also refers to the importance of water to the health of other species and ecosystems… recognizes not only inter-species, but also intergenerational fairness.
>
> *(VI.6 Justice)*


- It examines governance and law consequences (transboundary fairness, asymmetries): 

> Asymmetries in state power can promote unfair international water-sharing arrangements that are contrary to the concept of distributive justice.
>
> *(VI.7 Justice and International Transboundary Waters)*

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### EUONEHEALTH24: One Health governance in the European Union

- **Organisation**: SAPEA
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the report centrally engages justice frameworks (environmental, reproductive, epistemic) to extend One Health beyond humans, explicitly analysing inequities, proposing equity-oriented governance and resource distribution, and considering implications and consequences for nonhuman-inclusive decision-making, though it stops short of prescribing detailed binding legal mechanisms.

- The report explicitly argues for integrating justice into One Health ethics, highlighting conflicts of values across species and ecosystems and calling for engagement with social justice movements: 

> There have also been calls for further work on a more rigorous framework... account for the inevitable conflicts that arise between diverse interests and obligations owed to all who share the burden of disease and participate in the creation of ecological health, introducing justice into the conversation... this problem requires engagement not only with academic work on ethics and justice but, most importantly, with social movements and practical theorisations of social justice: environmental justice... environmental reproductive justice... and epistemic justice.
>
> *(One Health definition – Ethical considerations)*


- It identifies structural inequities and prescribes governance implications—equitable distribution of data and resources and advocating equity between sectors—linking ethics to institutional design: 

> One Health operationalisation is hampered by significant inequity and power imbalances between different sectors. A high-level governance organisation or actor could ensure the equal distribution of data and resources, and advocate for equity between sectors as part of decision-making to ensure equitable implementation of One Health policies.
>
> *(Executive summary – Evidence-based options for policy and research gaps)*


- It connects justice frameworks to outcomes and participation strategies (e.g., prioritising marginalised voices, epistemic humility), to ensure nonhuman-inclusive and equitable knowledge production: 

> Crucially, ethical reasoning... should not be done out of context... the complex ethical issues raised by One Health need to be addressed in partnership with, and perhaps led by, marginalised groups... collaboration requires both a priori informed consent and a nuanced view of epistemological ethics, including who owns knowledge and how downstream benefits are distributed.
>
> *(One Health definition – Ethical considerations)*


- It uses justice framing to articulate research and policy needs (equity by design; nonhuman welfare), linking concepts to goals and criteria for success: 

> Consideration must be given to barriers to... transdisciplinarity... enablers may include equity by design across sectors in how problems are approached, or consideration of what equitable outcomes would look like.
>
> *(One Health definition – Interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary collaboration)*


- It extends justice beyond humans by discussing animal welfare and rights as ethically relevant, exploring consequences (e.g., culling dilemmas, abolitionist arguments) for governance: 

> In the ethical framework of One Health, non-human beings and our environments... have more than an instrumental value and harm to them has ethical bearing... rights could be extended to animals... leads to a more comprehensive critique: the case for abolishing animal agriculture entirely...
>
> *(One Health definition – Ethical considerations; Box 2)*

#### UNTRANS25: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 1. Transformative change and a sustainable world

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because multispecies and Earth system justice are central to the 'equity and justice' principle guiding the framework, explicitly extending justice to nonhumans and considering implications for goals and evaluation, but with no concrete policy blueprint. - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> This includes fairness in terms of... participation in decision-making and change processes, and social recognition... the terms are used to ensure that the breadth of relevant considerations is captured... For transformative change... equity and justice expand to specifically encompass considerations for other species and natural entities... through... multispecies and Earth system justice.
>
> *(Section 1.3.2, Equity and justice)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Research emphasizes that ensuring equity and justice is crucial for global sustainability... The principle of equity and justice entails commitment to human rights and the rights of Indigenous Peoples and local communities... considerations such as intergenerational, restorative, multispecies and Earth system justice.
>
> *(Section 1.3.2)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Processes for ongoing learning and adaptation are particularly important for managing trade-offs, for example where climate measures negatively affect biodiversity, or where biodiversity measures result in inequities and injustices.
>
> *(Section 1.3.2, Adaptive learning and action)*

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### NZOCEAN21: The breaking wave: reforming the oceans management system in Aotearoa New Zealand

- **Organisation**: Environmental Defence Society
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because ecological justice is explicitly named and used to frame normative choices and trade-offs in oceans reform, with worked implications and hypotheticals (e.g., phasing out harmful gear, compensation, allocative fairness), shaping goals, strategies, and criteria for what a “just transition” in fisheries and marine protection should entail, but without fully specified binding mechanisms. 

- The document uses ecological justice to work through consequences for policy tools, including bans, compensation, and reallocation: 

> Finally, there is the concept of ecological justice to consider. Some have suggested that traditionally anthropocentric concepts like justice can be useful starting points for a more ecocentric view of the world. This sees the natural world as an actor within, not an object outside, the human community of justice. ... In short, climate change has impacts on multiple related fronts; a warming and acidifying ocean may directly reduce underlying ecosystem resilience...

 and later, applying justice lenses to transitions: 

> For example, would regulators simply impose a prohibition on certain inshore fishing methods such as bottom trawling and dredging? Would there instead be investment and government incentives to encourage new gear and less damaging methods? Would there be spatial exclusion of vessels from vulnerable or recovering areas, through marine protected areas?... And would that include both commercial and recreational interests?
>
> *(Chapter 4.8 and 4.4)*


- It links ecological justice to more-than-human actors and outcomes to guide allocative decisions and targets: 

> Should nature itself be conceived of as a separate entity, with interests or rights that should be separately recognised and defended?... We might lose a significant carbon sink without realising it, contributing to a vicious feedback loop of warming that impacts the oceans even more. ... What does an ecologically just transition actually involve other than changing the language our laws and regulations use?
>
> *(Chapter 4.8)*


- It uses ecological justice to develop criteria of success and negotiation strategies (zero bycatch, cultural koha, personhood): 

> Going further, should society build institutions that give the oceans a voice of their own? Can this build on the innovative legal personhood developed as part of the settlement processes for Te Urewera and Te Awa Tupua/Whanganui River, and what would be the challenges in giving the oceans as a whole legal personhood (eg through recognition as Tangaroa or Hinemoana)? Instead of a resource rental going back into the public purse, should that be treated as 'payment' or koha to nature for its services (or compensation for past harm) and be invested in regeneration projects?
>
> *(Chapter 4.8)*


- It articulates ecological justice as a foundation across ethical, technical, and political contexts (gear controls, spatial protections, compensation): 

> Whether the methods of transitioning away from environmental harm are just or not partly depends on how existing 'rights,' 'privileges' and 'interests' in the marine environment are perceived... There are no easy answers... It is arguable, for example, that compensation for the establishment of protected areas would be unfair...
>
> *(Chapter 4.6)*

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### EUCLIM24: Towards sustainable transformation: research priorities in climate change and biodiversity

- **Organisation**: EC
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because multispecies justice and post-anthropocentric governance are explicitly invoked to reframe planetary health governance, with implications and research questions on recognizing nonhuman agency, though not accompanied by detailed legal-institutional blueprints. - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Much of the biodiversity debate has focused on the concept of multispecies justice (Pineda-Pinto et al. 2023) and multispecies sustainability (Ruppercht et al. 2020), which both stress the need to move away from anthropocentrism.
>
> *(Section 4.2)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> There is a further research need to understand how to navigate and address the complexities that arise from diverse, and still largely anthropocentric, value systems.
>
> *(Section 4.2)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Key Research Gaps: What are the potential impacts of a governance system based on a concept of planetary health that recogni ses the agency of non-human elements in the environment, such as plants and animals?... Investigating methodologies for estimating, comprehending, and harnessing non-human agency in the governance of planetary health.

## Score 2: Theoretical Treatment

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### EIVIS23: Exploring new visions for a sustainable bioeconomy

- **Organisation**: JRC, EC
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because multispecies/planetary justice is explicitly referenced within a decolonial environmental justice framing and connected to concrete proposals (reparations, debt cancellation), but the multispecies justice dimension is not operationalized into institutions. - Context/synthesis: The report situates bioeconomy within global environmental justice and decolonial perspectives, calling for responsibility beyond human-only framings. 

> Global environmental justice requires a decolonial perspective that accommodates the marginalized actors’ (e.g. local and Indigenous communities) knowledge and legal systems, their right to self-determination and self-governing authority.
>
> *(p. 27)*


- Context/synthesis: It calls out recognition of rights of nature and multispecies justice in post-colonial contexts. 

> When acting in post-colonial states, pluralistic legal and cultural structures, indigenous knowledges, indigenous authorities, right of nature and multispecies justice need to be taken into consideration.
>
> *(p. 30)*


- Context/synthesis: It proposes concrete human policy steps (climate reparations, debt cancellation, reduce overconsumption) with environmental benefits but does not design multispecies justice institutions. 

> Such a recognition should be followed by... climate reparations and debt cancelation for the Global South countries.
>
> *(p. 29-30)*

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### UNLANDETHICS: Concept note of the World Commission on the Ethics of Scientific Knowledge and Technology (COMEST) on land-use ethics

- **Organisation**: UNESCO COMEST
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report extensively treats environmental justice (distributive, procedural, recognition) in land use and advocates measures like Free Prior Informed Consent, inclusion and procedural fairness; it connects to biodiversity, but remains primarily human-centered rather than explicitly multispecies justice. - It lays out environmental justice dimensions and procedural requirements: 

> Environmental justice should go beyond fair distribution and include procedural justice... opportunities for meaningful public participation... recognition of and respect for individuals and communities... citizens and communities should not be deprived of all the relevant information.
>
> *(III.2.3)*

 - It addresses land-grabbing, indigenous rights, and gender equity, linking justice to outcomes: “Land-use conflicts between companies and local land users over degradation of natural resources have increased… a land-use governance system guided by the principles of environmental justice… has a better chance of governing with integrity.” (III.2.3; II.1.1) - It recognizes interdependence with ecosystems, bridging towards ecological justice: 

> In an ecological and ecocentric context, solidarity recognises that both humans and other living organisms are dependent on land and its resources for existence.
>
> *(III.2.2)*

#### EURIGHTS: Towards an EU Charter of the Fundamental Rights of Nature

- **Organisation**: EESC
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the document discusses environmental/climate justice and the need for systemic justice for Nature, but it does not develop a separate ecological justice regime beyond the Charter’s rights and pillars.

- Justice framing: 

> There are two preliminary attempts... recognizing a common supranational protection between human rights and a healthy environment, which goes beyond the sectoral discipline of environmental law and qualifies the environment as a common space of humans-nature interaction.
>
> *(Section 2.1.1, p. 17)*


- Application in cases: 

> The 'People's Climate Case' highlights one of the main failures of EU Environmental Law... The claimed fundamental rights have not been discussed... A Charter... would have had a different outcome and higher chances to obtain the injunction on GHGs emissions reduction required by the plaintiffs.
>
> *(Section 3.9, p. 46-48)*

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### UNESCOEDU21: Reimagining our futures together: a new social contract for education

- **Organisation**: UNESCO
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report proposes pursuing social, economic and environmental justice as a goal for education and rebalancing relations with the living planet, but it does not explicitly frame rights or decision-making empowerment for nonhumans. - It sets justice aims that include the environment: 

> The new social contract for education must help us unite around collective endeavours and provide the knowledge and innovation needed to shape sustainable and peaceful futures for all anchored in social, economic and environmental justice.
>
> *(Introduction)*

 - It calls for rebalancing relations with the living planet: 

> We must urgently reinvent education to help us address common challenges... we must urgently reinvent education to help us address common challenges. This act of reimagining means working together to create futures that are shared and interdependent.
>
> *(Introduction)*
