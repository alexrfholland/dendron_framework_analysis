#### NEHALF20: Narratives for the Half Earth and Sharing the Planet scenarios

- **Organisation**: PBL
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because the report articulates the Sharing the Planet scenario as a destination with structured, implementable strategies (shared/working landscapes, ecological intensification, OECMs, placemaking/biophilic cities) and associated governance arrangements (local, decentralized), providing goals, instruments, and evaluative criteria. 

- Core vision and conservation strategy: “the SP scenario prioritises a protection centred on the instrumental and relational values of nature... conservation is centred around sustainable use... developed in a way to integrate human and nature systems into working mixed landscapes.” (Main findings; 2.2)

- Concrete land-use and design levers: “Shared (working) landscapes will be the dominant landscape... combining food production with the delivery of ecosystem services... agro-ecological techniques... cover cropping, crop rotation, intercropping.” (5.1.3; 5.2.2)

- Urban implementation via biophilic cities: “Cities are biophilic, that is they are designed to support well-being and health benefits by connecting people with nature... inter-connected city parks and green and blue infrastructure.” (2.2; 5.1.3)

- Governance approach: “authors... favour local governance systems whereby the value of nature is primarily created locally... a high level of decentralisation... combining recreation, education and conservation to create a context-specific joint management plan.” (Main findings; 6.2.3; 6.2.6)

- Area-based measures beyond PAs: “OECM... flexible area-based approaches are employed... nature conservation objectives are either by-products or secondary objectives of management activities.” (2.2; 5.1.4)
