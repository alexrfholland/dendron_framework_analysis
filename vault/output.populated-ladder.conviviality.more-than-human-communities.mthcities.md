# Multispecies cities, multispecies urban planning, multispecies disaster preparedness

## Score 4: Actionable Mechanisms

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### DWILD20: Designing wildlife-inclusive cities

- **Organisation**: None
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because the article explicitly proposes urban planning and design for human–animal co-existence, embedding animal needs into urban processes and offering a process model (planning cycle) and applied case features. 

- Multispecies co-existence aim: “Designing wildlife-inclusive cities that support human-animal co-existence… we propose how wildlife-inclusive urban design could be included into the different steps of the urban planning cycle.” (Title; Abstract)

- Urban scale and built-up focus: “Wildlife-inclusive urban design focusses at the very local level where urban development takes place… develops new habitat opportunities… in the parts of the city (the built-up area) where wildlife conservation has so far not been a priority.” (2. Urban planning and the concept)

- Implementation stages and stakeholders: “During the analysis and draft phase and the detailed planning and design phase, close cooperation of ecologists and designers… During project realisation… After finalization… Post-Occupancy Evaluation of biodiversity… Evaluating ecosystem services, social and economic issues.” (3.2 Planning cycle)

- Outcomes/criteria: features for success, monitoring of target species, social/economic evaluation feed into best practices: “All of the projects included some form of biodiversity monitoring… social and economic monitoring… Feedback to authorities; exchange with residents.” (Table 2; 3.1)

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### UNCITIES21: Global environment outlook for cities – towards green and just cities (GEO for Cities)

- **Organisation**: UNEP & UN-Habitat
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because the report positions multispecies cities as a central design and governance practice and provides detailed, actionable mechanisms (urban biodiversity plans, habitat corridors, pollinator citizenship, multispecies disaster plans), with case studies and implementation steps integrated into decarbonization and resilience pathways.

- Conceptual foundation and urban design scope: 

> Such an approach encompasses the idea of a city that respects nature and protects and restores the diversity of life... a multispecies city... where 'those who control and plan cities [...] consider the more-than-human'... planning for urban nature becomes more widespread.
>
> *(Chapter 4, 4.2.3)*


- Concrete tools and plans (implementation): 

> Multispecies and nature-positive strategies should advance along two simultaneous tracks: 1. Urban biodiversity plans and habitat designs... create single and multispecies habitat and landscape corridors... and 2. Multispecies disaster preparedness plans that recognize the vital role played by companion animals, domestic animals, urban wildlife and plants.
>
> *(Chapter 4, 4.2.3)*


- Case mechanisms and indicators: 

> Curridabat’s innovative 'Sweet City' urban plan... pollinators are recognized as official citizens... Baseline... established a 'pollinator district' that links land use regulations to pollinator needs... Oslo’s bee highway... identifying 'precautionary zones' where wild bees may need additional protection.
>
> *(Chapter 4, 4.2.3; Figure 4.3)*


- Integration into resilience pathways: 

> Design for robustness and safe failure... leverage the greatest co-benefits... and build adaptive capacity

—including biodiversity and animal/plant considerations in resilience design and operations. (Chapter 5, 5.4.2; Figure 5.9)

## Score 3: Core Conceptual Device / Implications Explored

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### IUCNBUILD25: Catalysing biodiversity on buildings: a review of supporting initiatives in European cities

- **Organisation**: IUCN
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Design/Engineering

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the report advances multispecies urban planning at the building scale (cohabitation with native species, wildlife-friendly standards) as a core organizing concept, and works through implications, tools, and policies (metrics, incentives, standards) across ethical, technical, and political contexts; it stops short of a binding single-city mandate. - The report centers cities as multispecies landscapes, moving from greening to cohabitation: “cities need to move from a place of greening to cohabitation with native species.” (Conclusions) “Cities offer the potential to create needed ecological connectivity... and nurture climate-resilient ecosystems... connect humans and nature...” (Executive Summary) - It develops practical design and policy implications (green roofs/walls, bird-safe glass, lighting standards, metrics like UGF/BAF) to include nonhuman needs in urban decisions: “This scale includes green roofs and walls, measures to safeguard wildlife against building hazards like reflective surfaces, and special resources such as nesting boxes and refuge for pollinators.” (Section 2) - It specifies outcomes, indicators and criteria (e.g., Urban Greening Factor, Biotope Area Factor, performance tiers): “Metrics and tools can play a critical role... Urban Greening Factor tool... Green compensation calculation... Berlin Biotope Area Factor...” (2.4; 4.1.2) - It addresses ethical/political challenges and negotiation strategies (historic preservation, housing): “Historic preservation... measures to introduce biodiversity at the building scale must be implemented in a way that preserves historic building assets... Perceived competition for space with affordable housing...” (Conclusions) - It links to regional/global policy targets to guide multispecies metrics and goals: “Target 12 [GBF]... biodiversity-inclusive urban planning... enhancing native biodiversity, ecological connectivity...” (3.1); “Nature Restoration Law... green roofs and walls... no net loss of urban green space.” (3.2)

## Score 2: Theoretical Treatment

### SCENARIOS AND FUTURES EXPLORATION

#### PBLNATUREPOS22: Exploring nature-positive pathways: contribution to CBD Post-2020 GBF

- **Organisation**: PBL Netherlands EA
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because cities are treated as crucial arenas for biodiversity action with detailed governance levers, but the framing remains primarily human-led urban policy rather than explicitly multispecies citizenship or co-deliberation.

- Cities as arenas for biodiversity with structural regime-change framing: “Cities are crucial arenas… transformative change in urban development towards nature will require a fundamental shift in the ‘urban infrastructure regime’… engagement… across the regulatory, urban development and financial domains.” (p. 24–26)

- Policy mixes and mechanisms for urban biodiversity planning: “Policymakers… a range of regulatory, financial and ‘soft’ governing mechanisms… combining these mechanisms is essential for generating transformative impacts.” (p. 26)

- Recognition of equitable provision of urban nature and socio-spatial justice: “Urban greening may exacerbate socio-spatial inequities… design deliberative and inclusive processes to overcome uneven and inequitable urban nature provision.” (p. 26)
