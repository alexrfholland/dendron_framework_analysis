# INTERDIS_BARRIERS: Interdisciplinary barriers

## Sources and Questions

### ISCHEALTH21: Urban health and wellbeing in the Anthropocene: interdisciplinary science-action plan 2021–2025

**Question**: How can stronger cooperation across specialized science programmes and with city governments be built to govern urban complexity for planetary and population health?

**Evidence**: 

> The UHWB programme has been visionary in its attempt to promote a better systemic understanding of urban health and wellbeing by means of a systems approach. However, it has been a struggle to build stronger cooperation with more specialised science programmes (which either focus on ‘urban’, ‘health’ or ‘environment’) and with city governments – a process which requires leadership and which cannot rest on the shoulders of a small science programme alone.

### UNCITIES21: Global environment outlook for cities – towards green and just cities (GEO for Cities)

**Question**: How can city institutions overcome siloed departmental structures to mainstream just transitions and multispecies considerations?

**Evidence**: “City governments typically have separate and specialized bureaucratic departments... Institutional silos and poor interdepartmental communication and coordination are challenges for mainstreaming just transition objectives, which require close collaboration across multiple departments.” (Chapter 2, 2.3.3)
“Fostering inter-city exchange and co-learning... there is enormous value in sharing experiences with other cities.” (Summary for city-level decision makers, p. 11)

### TWITRANS18: Transformations to achieve the sustainable development goals

**Question**: How to overcome sectoral and disciplinary fragmentation to design integrative, multi-scale sustainability solutions?

**Evidence**: “Rather than investigate the role of water, or food, or energy, or even the water-food-energy nexus, we should design an approach that truly integrates all possible domains affected, focuses on tradeoffs and co-benefits and generally takes a holistic perspective that is at the core of 2030 Agenda.” (Transformations to sustainable development)
“The sectorial approach is not getting us any further… We need to adopt a holistic approach to reach the next level of understanding of the very complex socioenvironmental dynamics…” (Key Messages, 2.1.1–2.1.3)

### UNLAND17_2: The Global Land Outlook: Part 2 - The Outlook

**Question**: What institutional and practical measures can overcome entrenched sectoral silos to implement integrated land–water management at scale?

**Evidence**: 

> Water planning (where it occurs at all) tends to follow a piecemeal or siloed approach, with different sectors... competing rather than collaborating at the expense of the common good.
>
> *(Chapter 8, Indirect causes of water insecurity)*

> IWRM has been an aspiration for decades but has often failed in practice due to entrenched sectoral interests, political and governance barriers, and the failure to engender a sense of collective responsibility.
>

### EUINVASIVE24: IPBES Invasive Alien Species Assessment: Chapter 1. Introducing Biological Invasions and the IPBES Thematic Assessment of Invasive Alien Species and Their Control

**Question**: How can socioecological complexity, human behaviour, and multiple interacting drivers be integrated into predictive models and management of IAS?

**Evidence**: - Context/synthesis: The chapter explicitly notes the challenge of integrating social dimensions with ecological dynamics. “There have been considerable advances... increasingly, scientists are recognizing the inherent difficulties of forecasting these processes in complex socioecological systems... The sphere of social interactions and human behaviour increases the complexity of mitigation efforts...” (Section 1.5)

- Context/synthesis: It stresses the multiplicative interactions among drivers (e.g., climate, land-use, IAS) complicating inference and prediction. “Drivers may act alone or interact... leading to additive or multiplicative effects... it is difficult to determine the relative importance of one driver over another.” (Section 1.3.3)

---

### UNPLANETBOUND22: Thematic study: planetary boundaries

**Question**: How can we build coherent, cross-regime, interdisciplinary approaches to capture synergies and manage cascading risks?

**Evidence**: “It is becoming increasingly evident that new efforts are needed to replace the business-as-usual/siloed approaches in order to build synergies and mutually beneficial opportunities across policies and practices... this necessarily involves governments addressing existing regimes horizontally and vertically with new forms of coordination.” (Part 1.4)

---

### EUONEHEALTH24: One Health governance in the European Union

**Question**: How can One Health overcome disciplinary languages, valuation of qualitative/quantitative evidence, and sectoral cultures to achieve integrated action?

**Evidence**: “Challenges such as the need to develop a shared language, and differing opinions on the relative value of quantitative and qualitative research, will need to be overcome.” (One Health definition – Interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary collaboration)
“For a One Health approach to work, there may need to be significant cultural shifts within agencies and changes in attitudes and relationships between professions.” (EU policies – One Health policy landscape in member states)

---

### IPBESTCA4: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 4. Overcoming the challenges of achieving transformative change

**Question**: What inhibits knowledge co-production and interdisciplinary collaboration necessary for transformative change?

**Evidence**: “The lack of knowledge co-production between academic disciplines results in an incomplete understanding of the barriers and opportunities for knowledge and innovation systems to be levers for transformative change… The paucity of funding for collaborative research, conventional approaches to knowledge exchange, science in-accessibility and traditional academic reward systems discourage interdisciplinary collaboration deterring knowledge exchange and transfer within and between countries.” (4.2.5)

### NZOCEAN21: The breaking wave: reforming the oceans management system in Aotearoa New Zealand

**Question**: Challenges integrating mātauranga Māori with Western science and policy processes.

**Evidence**: “Mātauranga Māori cannot simply be ‘collected’... it is sacred knowledge... A different perspective... Weaving mātauranga Māori together with other approaches... is a work in progress for Fisheries NZ.” (Chapter 8.4)
“the courts have started to engage in an analysis of the relationship between the ‘first and second laws’ of Aotearoa New Zealand and their impact on the current legal system.” (Chapter 3.1 Tikanga spotlight)

---

### EURIGHTS: Towards an EU Charter of the Fundamental Rights of Nature

**Question**: How to bridge the fragmentation between legal systems and complex ecological science to enable more-than-human governance?

**Evidence**: “A radically different whole-systems approach is needed... the fundamental mismatch between a fragmented, mechanistic, reductionist... system of law - with the holistic, dynamic, multidimensional and unpredictable nature of complex adaptive systems such as Nature and human societies... If law is to be part of the solution, a radically different whole-systems approach is needed.” (Section 5.5, p. 69)
“Therefore, it is necessary not only to guarantee the public right to information, but above all to integrate legal languages with scientific ones and with the culture of local communities.” (Section 5.6.4, p. 83)

### UNSECURITY24: Envisioning security for a more-than-human world

**Question**: How can One Health and integrated security be informed by humanities and social sciences to avoid technocratic fixes and growth-centric biases?

**Evidence**: “Academically, the ‘one health’ discourse tends to be dominated by the sciences. We need to ensure a level of reflexivity that allows arts, humanities and social science contributions... We need to avoid falling into the trap of ‘technological fix es’... oriented for corporate profit.” (One Health and governance)

### IRELANDAAD22: Southern Regional Assembly 2020 Annual Report

**Question**: How can regional authorities coordinate across utilities, local authorities, and stakeholders to actively plan and collaborate so that Blue-Green Infrastructure and Nature-Based Solutions (including more-than-human design like AAD) are used sustainably and effectively?

**Evidence**: “BGI and NBS will only provide us with benefits if we actively plan, coordinate, and collaborate to ensure that they are utilised sustainably. The Southern Regional Assembly is therefore working with a wide range of stakeholders to ensure this is achieved. Irish Water sees this collaboration as a way of relieving constraints on combined drainage networks for urban areas and regard Sustainable Drainage Systems as an effective way to achieve this. The motivation of local authorities is wide ranging but broadly include health and wellbeing, placemaking, biodiversity, water quality.” (Section 7, Blue Green City)

---

### DBIO23: Integrating biodiversity in urban development

**Question**: How can ecological research findings be translated and disseminated effectively to built-environment practitioners?

**Evidence**: “Only 84 publications, or 19 %, attempted to reach planners, architects and/or landscape architects... The transdisciplinary gap and practice-academic gaps are barriers that limit practitioners’ ability to access the newest urban ecology findings for informed biodiversity inclusive design practice.” (3.1.2; 4.4)

---

### NEHALF20: Narratives for the Half Earth and Sharing the Planet scenarios

**Question**: How can agriculture–conservation integration overcome conceptual and practical conflicts between land sparing and land sharing?

**Evidence**: “the nexus between food production and biodiversity is at the core of many current conservation debates... land sparing and sustainable intensification... shared landscapes... The differences... have important implications... for conservation strategies.” (4.2; 5.2; 3.3)
