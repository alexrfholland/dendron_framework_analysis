### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### EUANTHRO: Exiting the Anthropocene? Exploring fundamental change in our relationship with nature

- **Organisation**: EEA
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the Symbiocene is discussed as an ontological and ethical reorientation (‘an age in which humans base action on symbiosis’) with implications for governance and behaviour, but without practical institutional design.

- Context/synthesis: The text positions the Symbiocene as the counter to the Anthropocene, specifying its normative content: “a vision of a future world where humans realise that we are in symbiosis with all other species and the entire biosphere.” (p.8–9)

- Context/synthesis: It connects this to responsibility and multispecies flourishment (outcomes), indicating potential criteria for success: “working for multispecies flourishment.” (p.9)
