### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### IPBESPATHWAYS19: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 5. Realizing a sustainable world for nature and people: transformative strategies, actions and roles for all

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the chapter explicitly acknowledges and references ‘intuitive interspecies communication’ as an approach to include more-than-human knowledge in decision-making; however, it is presented as part of co-creation discourse without detailed, actionable institutional mechanisms.

- The chapter recognizes interspecies communication as a way to include nonhuman knowledge: 

> Recent research includes arguments for the use of intuitive interspecies communication to facilitate inclusion of more-than-human knowledge in conservation decision-making (Abbott, 2021; Barrett et al., 2021; Wijngaarden, 2023).
>
> *(5.7.5)*


- It locates the approach within broader co-creation and knowledge pluralism to influence policy and law: 

> Co-creation also serves as an essential pillar for counteracting disinformation... different knowledge holders and practitioners, together with scientists, are needed to enable political mechanisms and legal actions...
>
> *(5.7.5)*

## Score 1: Token Acknowledgement

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### IPBESTCA2: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 2. Visions of a sustainable world – for nature and people

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because interspecies/more-than-human communication is briefly mentioned as part of eco-social imaginaries, but only as a passing example without elaboration of methods or mechanisms.

- The chapter lists it as one of several ideas to shift human–nature relations: 

> Diverse ideas include initiatives such as Wilson’s advocacy for half Earth (E. Wilson, 2016), rights of nature... transformative ways of human and non-human nature relating through intuitive communication (Barrett et al., 2017)...
>
> *(2.4.2)*


- Prevents higher score: no extended discussion of methods, instrumentation, or governance use of interspecies communication.
