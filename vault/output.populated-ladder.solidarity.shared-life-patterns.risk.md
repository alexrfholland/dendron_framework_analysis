# Disaster risk reduction

## Score 4: Actionable Mechanisms

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### UNPLANETBOUND22: Thematic study: planetary boundaries

- **Organisation**: UNDRR
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because DRR is reworked as a more-than-human practice (integrating ecosystems and PB) and the report provides extensive, actionable steps under all four Sendai Priorities (understanding risk, governance, investing, preparedness), including methods, indicators, and coordination mechanisms. - It recasts DRR around Earth-system limits: 

> The era of hazard-by-hazard risk reduction is over... Understanding the degree of cascading risk and developing ways to isolate, measure and manage or prevent systemic risk is the new challenge now faced by the world... Increased understanding of planetary boundaries supports the conceptual shift from managing disaster to managing disaster risk, strengthening prevention and building resilient societies and ecosystems.
>
> *(Part 2.3.2, Priority for Action 1, Messages 1.1)*

 - It lays out DRR governance reforms: 

> Disaster risk governance needs to be strengthened to address the new global risks and insecurities that have been generated by transgression of key planetary boundaries... multilevel governance... guiding framework and standard of practice, as well as comparative tools to monitor and evaluate actions at every level.
>
> *(Part 2.3.2, Priority for Action 2, Message 2.1)*

 - It operationalizes investment and procurement: 

> Accelerate financing for disaster risk reduction and ensure that public and private investments are informed by planetary boundaries... Think Resilience approach... become mandatory in all public procurement processes... mandatory reporting requirements... robust risk assessment in public infrastructure spending.
>
> *(Part 2.3.2, Priority for Action 3, Message 3.1)*

 - It explicitly integrates ecosystems into preparedness: 

> Ecosystems and ecosystem management are currently missing from Sendai Framework Priority area 4, and should be integrated to reflect the important role that healthy ecosystems play in mitigating disaster risk... Global sustainability regimes increase coordination and collaboration to capture untapped synergy potential.
>

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### UNCITIES21: Global environment outlook for cities – towards green and just cities (GEO for Cities)

- **Organisation**: UNEP & UN-Habitat
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because disaster risk reduction is embedded as a practice framework in resilience pathways with concrete mechanisms (resilience assessments, safe failure design, early warning, community relief centers), and case-tested implementation (Cape Town Day Zero; Alappuzha; DVP Seattle), aligning with Sendai-aligned outcomes and indicators.

- Framework to outcomes: 

> The developmental approach to urban resilience considers how chronic stress and vulnerability... contribute to risks... The result is an urban resilience model focused on the city’s underlying capacity to absorb shocks, adapt and 'bounce forward'...
>
> *(Chapter 5, 5.4)*


- Concrete mechanisms: 

> Design for robustness and safe failure, and prevent cascading impacts from shock events... leverage the greatest co-benefits... build adaptive capacity

 with cross-cutting design guidance. (Chapter 5, 5.4.2; Figure 5.9)

- Institutional practice and indicators: 

> Resilience assessments... performance indicators can be developed to help monitor and guide contributions... new senior management functions... Chief Resilience Officers...
>
> *(Chapter 5, 5.4.1)*


- Case execution: 

> By early 2018, the city [Cape Town] was preparing for 'Day Zero'... The Day Zero communication campaign reduced city-wide water use by 40 per cent from 2015 levels... while drafting its broader resilience strategy... based on scenarios... stress tests.
>
> *(Chapter 5, Box 5.5)*

## Score 3: Core Conceptual Device / Implications Explored

### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### UNSECURITY24: Envisioning security for a more-than-human world

- **Organisation**: UNDP
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the paper uses DRR ideas to argue for locally attuned, more-than-human security initiatives (e.g., Cuban Risk Reduction Management Centres), their transnational scaling, and integration with human–environmental knowledge, but it does not provide a comprehensive DRR implementation roadmap. - It presents a multispecies-informed DRR case: “The extension of Cuba’s Risk Reduction Management Centres across the region from 2011... encompassed preparedness plans that integrated local forms of governance and knowledge into scalable systems... with each Centre collecting, analysing and coordinating risk and disaster information to feed into decision-making by government authorities.” (Human–environmental security and local contextualization) - It frames DRR within more-than-human security: “Attending to the local is the starting point in achieving an integrated and globally conceived sense of security... The urgency of hearing and responding to voices from the margins became even more acute during COVID-19.” (Local contextualization section) - It argues for avoiding technocratic top-down security: “Statist security is commonly activated in a top-down manner and centrally involves a reductive and technocratic understanding of security... This serves to negate perspectives that could productively be drawn upon to orient more progressive and transformative visions of security.” (Local contextualization)

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### UNESCOAI23: Recommendation on the ethics of artificial intelligence

- **Organisation**: UNESCO
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because disaster risk reduction is embedded in environmental policy actions with clear implications for how AI should be used (prediction, prevention, control, mitigation), linked to incentives and safeguards; it does not set a comprehensive DRR regime but guides sectoral deployment. - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Member States should introduce incentives... to ensure the development and adoption of rights-based and ethical AI-powered solutions for disaster risk resilience; the monitoring, protection and regeneration of the environment and ecosystems; and the preservation of the planet.
>
> *(Policy Area 5)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Some examples include using AI systems, when needed and appropriate, to: Support the prediction, prevention, control and mitigation of climate-related problems.
>
> *(Policy Area 5)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> When choosing AI methods... given the potential data-intensive or resource-intensive character... the precautionary principle must be favoured, and in instances where there are disproportionate negative impacts on the environment, AI should not be used.
>
> *(Policy Area 5)*

## Score 2: Theoretical Treatment

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### UNLAND17_2: The Global Land Outlook: Part 2 - The Outlook

- **Organisation**: UNCCD
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because disaster risk reduction (DRR) is discussed with empirical detail (flood/drought hazards, protected areas for DRR) and policy relevance, but the text does not present a DRR governance architecture or city/land-use DRR standards as actionable mechanisms for inclusion/implementation.

- Quantifies water-related disaster risk and links to planning needs: 

> Since 1900, 90 per cent of disasters from natural hazards have been related to water. Flooding accounted for 47 per cent of weather‑related disasters from 1995‑2005, with over 3,000 flood disasters affecting 2.3 billion people and killing 157,000.
>
> *(Chapter 8, Rising number of extreme climatic events)*


- Identifies nature-based DRR measures (wetlands and protected areas) and their policy use: 

> Wetlands absorb floodwater providing disaster risk reduction

 and 

> An increasing number of countries rely on strategically located protected areas as part of their disaster risk reduction policies.
>
> *(Chapter 8, Protecting and restoring natural ecosystems; Chapter 8, Protecting and restoring natural ecosystems)*


- Connects urbanization and DRR exposure, highlighting governance gaps without detailed standards: 

> Urban areas in low elevation coastal zones (LECZ) are growing faster than elsewhere... Without adequate protection, the impacts of climate change will devastate economies and infrastructure... while 70 per cent of high-income countries integrate land use and natural risk management, only about 15 per cent of low-income countries do so.
>
> *(Chapter 11, Peri-urbanization)*

#### UNLAND17_1: The Global Land Outlook: Part 1 - The Big Picture

- **Organisation**: UNCCD
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report explicitly develops Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) through ecosystem-based mechanisms and provides structured roles and examples, but does not translate into detailed policy instruments or institutionalization steps.

- DRR is treated as a thematic area with clear ecosystem functions that mitigate hazards: 

> Natural and well-managed ecosystems are important for mitigating the impacts of extreme weather events and the progression into full-fledged disasters. The worst disasters, in terms of loss of human life and economic costs, are often in those places where natural defenses have been degraded or destroyed.
>
> *(Chapter 4, Convergence of Evidence, ‘Disaster risk reduction’, p. 71)*


- The report enumerates DRR functions by ecosystem type, moving beyond rhetoric to functional roles (goals and criteria): 

> Some key benefits of ecosystem services in terms of disaster risk reduction (DRR) are outlined in Table 4.2.

 The table then specifies for multiple hazards: 

> Flooding – Providing space for floodwaters to dissipate…; Landslide – Stabilizing soil; Storm surge, tsunamis, erosion – Corals and mangroves creating a natural barrier…; Droughts and desertification – Reducing pressure…; Fires – Maintaining traditional management systems…; Hurricanes and typhoons – Buffering communities…; Earthquakes – Preventing or mitigating associated hazards including landslides and rock falls.
>
> *(Chapter 4, Table 4.2, p. 72)*


- It connects DRR to practical cases, showing implications and outcomes: 

> After the Asian tsunami of 2004, a study in Sri Lanka found that an area with a diverse landscape… was much less seriously affected than areas that had been cleared of natural vegetation, as these ecosystems absorbed much of the energy of the waves.
>
> *(Chapter 4, p. 71)*


- Although the report advances DRR logic and evidence, it stops short of presenting implementable DRR policy designs or governance frameworks beyond case illustrations and role descriptions.

## Score 1: Token Acknowledgement

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### EUONEHEALTH24: One Health governance in the European Union

- **Organisation**: SAPEA
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction is referenced to note integrated health-environment measures, but not elaborated as a One Health DRR program within the EU context here.

- The report explicitly references DRR within the UN landscape and its integrated approach relevance: 

> Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030- mentions the prevention and reduction of new and existing disaster risk through the implementation of integrated […] health, environmental, […] measures
>
> *(EU policies – The international One Health policy landscape)*


- The mention situates DRR within the One Health-aligned policy environment without operational detail in this report.
