# ETHICAL_UNRESOLVED: Unresolved ethical challenges

## Sources and Questions

### UNLEGAL: Environmental rule of law: tracking progress and charting future directions

**Question**: How should legal systems conceptualize and remedy the rights of future generations who do not yet exist?

**Evidence**: “Framing interests of future generations in terms of obligations or benefits instead of rights is one way to navigate around the key conceptual problem in granting rights to future generations: the fact that they do not (yet) exist… This raises broad philosophical questions as well as practical problems related to standing and remedies.” (Chapter 4, Section 4.3.4)

### EUONEHEALTH24: One Health governance in the European Union

**Question**: How should One Health governance negotiate conflicts between human safety, animal welfare, Indigenous foodways, and ecological protection?

**Evidence**: “Although [culling] is a common method to prevent the spread of infectious pathogens, culling raises questions about how human safety should be balanced with animal welfare... our position is that such anthropocentrism needs to be questioned... abolishing animal agriculture is an out-of-context argument when it comes to Indigenous foodways... different ways to consider... may be overlooked...” (One Health definition – Box 2: Complex issues in One Health ethics)

### EUDOLPHIN15: Dolphinaria - A Review of the Keeping of Whales and Dolphins in Captivity in the European Union and EC Directive 1999/22, Relating to the Keeping of Wild Animals in Zoos

**Question**: Given higher mortality and stress in captivity and failure to meet biological needs, should dolphinaria be phased out in favor of sanctuaries and non-captive conservation?

**Evidence**: - Context/synthesis: The report concludes that dolphinaria fail to meet biological requirements and that captivity causes stress and stereotypies. “No captive cetacean in the EU has the freedom to express normal behaviour... Stress and stereotypic behaviour are common among captive cetaceans. Dolphinaria in the EU are failing to comply with the requirements of EC Directive 1999/22.” (Summary; Animal wellbeing and welfare)

- Context/synthesis: It recommends phasing out dolphinaria and shifting to rehabilitation/retirement. “Prepare plans to phase out national dolphinaria by prohibiting captive breeding; prohibiting the import of further cetaceans... Where appropriate... transfer captive cetaceans to rehabilitation, retirement and/or release programmes...” (Recommendations to EU Member States, point 8)

### UNLANDETHICS: Concept note of the World Commission on the Ethics of Scientific Knowledge and Technology (COMEST) on land-use ethics

**Question**: How can conflicting SDGs and land-use goals (food, energy, biodiversity) be balanced ethically and equitably?

**Evidence**: “Land use should balance competing land users across different sectors... energy production should not trump food, and food should not trump biodiversity, and vice versa... The breadth of issues covered by the SDGs... mean that complex interactions between goals and targets are inevitable.” (I.2 Biodiversity; I.3 SDGs)

### ZOO23: Looking at Individual Interests beyond Species Conservation in Zoos.

**Question**: Can zoos adequately respect individual animal interests while pursuing species conservation in an artificial setting, and how should trade-offs be managed?

**Evidence**: - Context/synthesis: The author highlights the unresolved ethical dilemma between individual welfare and species-level conservation objectives. “Saving species, however, can come at a costly price to an animal’s welfare... As public institutions, zoos sometimes struggle to balance conservation priorities with their ethical obligations to offer individual animals a good quality of life.” (Main text)

- Context/synthesis: It questions feasibility of meaningfully honoring individuals’ interests in a context that instrumentalizes them. “The question is to know if it is possible to adequately adhere to individual animal interests within an artificial context where individual animals fundamentally represent ‘other’ collective populations and species in the wild.” (Main text)

### UNGEOETHICS22: Concept note of the World Commission on the Ethics of Scientific Knowledge and Technology (COMEST) on the ethics of climate engineering

**Question**: How should intrinsic value of nature and rights of nature/animals be weighed against human survival aims in climate engineering ethics?

**Evidence**: “How to deal with the intrinsic value of 'nature' when nature becomes an engineering project? Should we also attribute moral rights to nature: to oceans, rivers, ice caps? Whose moral rights should be respected: those of currently living human beings, or also those of future generations?” (Introduction)

### UNESCOBIO11: Ethics and biodiversity

**Question**: Moral agency and prioritization remain unresolved in more-than-human ethics.

**Evidence**: “Moral agency is... contentious... virtues cannot be imposed in egalitarian theories without clear problems of anthropomorphizing... Prioritization is perhaps the core issue of ethics and biodiversity... The ethics of prioritization are the most difficult to contemplate, justify and even more so to communicate.” (2.9 Moral Agency; 2.10 Prioritization)
