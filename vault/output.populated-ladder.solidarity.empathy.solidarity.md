## Score 3: Core Conceptual Device / Implications Explored

### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### UNESCOEDU20: Learning to become with the world: education for future survival

- **Organisation**: Common Worlds/UNESCO
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Humanities/Ethics

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because solidarity is advanced as a core educational disposition (collective dispositions, convivial relations) and extended to more-than-human communities; the paper details implications for pedagogy and shared governance of worlds, without specifying institutional mechanisms. - It reorients education to collective dispositions of solidarity: 

> The individualistic culture of the self is now a thing of the past. Collective dispositions are the order of the day... openness to the ‘Other’ – whether other humans, species, Land, ancestors, or cyborgs and machines.
>
> *(Visionary declarations, 4)*

 - Solidarity is enacted through staying with multi-species trouble and co-creating worlds: 

> We insist on ‘staying with the trouble’... promoting situated learning as a means to co-construct worlds that are more liveable for all.
>
> *(Visionary declarations, 5)*

 - Cosmopolitical solidarity includes nonhumans: 

> We now see the practice of cosmopolitical education as integral to the processes of ‘becoming worldly,’ ‘worlding with,’ or ‘becoming with.’
>
> *(Visionary declarations, 6)*

#### UNGEOETHICS22: Concept note of the World Commission on the Ethics of Scientific Knowledge and Technology (COMEST) on the ethics of climate engineering

- **Organisation**: UNESCO COMEST
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because solidarity is explicitly applied to recognize human interdependency with other species and ecosystems, forming a core evaluative lens (UNESCO Declaration Principle 6) for climate engineering ethics and distribution of risks/benefits, though operational governance remains to be detailed. - It interprets solidarity beyond humans: 

> The principle of Solidarity (Article 6) underlines the interdependency of humankind with one another, but also with other species and ecosystems. Climate engineering highlights the tension between anthropocentric and ecocentric views of nature.
>
> *(II. Ethical issues)*

 - It connects solidarity to questions of moral standing and justice distribution: 

> Can and should survival of the human species be the ultimate goal of interventions? What about the rights of animals and the intrinsic value of nature? What about the rights of future generations?
>
> *(II. Ethical issues)*

 - It commits to intercultural perspectives that embed solidarity: 

> Given the global character of the impact of climate change and climate engineering, an intercultural ethical perspective is needed... bring together a diversity of ethical frameworks... responsibilities towards nature.
>
> *(III. Intercultural ethical perspectives)*

#### COMESTWATER22: Report of COMEST on water ethics: ocean, freshwater and coastal areas

- **Organisation**: UNESCO COMEST
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because solidarity is developed as a core guiding ethical principle extended to humans and ecosystems (more-than-human), and the report explores its implications and applications (e.g., governance, stewardship, trade-offs), though it does not provide a single operational policy instrument dedicated solely to solidarity. 

- The report elevates ecological solidarity beyond humans: 

> Solidarity recogniz(es) the interdependency between humankind, and between humans and ecosystems for survival and existence. It requires us to act in an ecological and ecocentric context, acknowledging the dependence of other biotic communities on water for existence, and the need to share resources.
>
> *(VI.2 Solidarity)*


- It links solidarity to common good and cross-scale governance needs: 

> The challenges of pollution and depletion of marine resources offer examples that underline the need for solidarity not only between humans, but also between humans and ecosystems.
>
> *(VI.2)*


- It ties solidarity to practical governance and trade-offs among SDGs: 

> The international community is encouraged to increase understanding of the ethical challenges associated with SDGs, including awareness of how they interact or conflict with each other.
>
> *(VII.a.ii)*


- It frames solidarity as informing criteria for success and co-benefits (e.g., stewardship): 

> Solidarity… has been forwarded by COMEST as a key principle in water ethics (UNESCO, 2004), and as one of the guiding ethical principles for Climate Change (UNESCO, 2015).
>
> *(VI.2)*

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### UNLANDETHICS: Concept note of the World Commission on the Ethics of Scientific Knowledge and Technology (COMEST) on land-use ethics

- **Organisation**: UNESCO COMEST
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because solidarity (and interdependency) is articulated as a guiding principle that explicitly includes other species and ecosystems, used to shape goals (balancing multi-functionality, shared resources), and connected to recommendations, though not prescribing specific solidarity institutions. - It defines solidarity in more-than-human terms: 

> Solidarity guides us to respect the needs of people within and between nations, as well as across generations. In an ecological and ecocentric context, solidarity recognises that both humans and other living organisms are dependent on land and its resources for existence.
>
> *(III.2.2 Solidarity and Interdependency)*

 - It highlights implications (trade-offs across SDGs, multispecies impacts): 

> Recognising the international challenges of land-use and sustainability forms a central part of the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration... Land use should balance competing land users across different sectors in a rational, optimal, transparent and fair manner.
>
> *(I.2; Biodiversity)*

 - It ties solidarity to actionable governance recommendations: “Integrated landscape management should identify and respect the multi-functionality of landscapes for food production, resource exploitation, cultural heritage and ecosystem conservation.” (Part IV: Recommendations, Governance)

## Score 2: Theoretical Treatment

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### UNESCOEDU21: Reimagining our futures together: a new social contract for education

- **Organisation**: UNESCO
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report repeatedly elevates solidarity (and care) as a guiding educational principle and calls for a global solidarity agenda, but does so primarily to support human communities, not explicitly empowering nonhuman beings. - Solidarity is framed as a principle for pedagogy: 

> Pedagogy should be organized around the principles of cooperation, collaboration, and solidarity. It should foster the intellectual, social, and moral capacities of students to work together and transform the world with empathy and compassion.
>
> *(Executive summary; Chapter 3)*

 - It issues a call for global solidarity and cooperation: 

> A call for global solidarity and international cooperation. A new social contract for education requires renewed commitment to global collaboration in support of education as a common good... Beyond North-South flows of aid to education, the generation of knowledge and evidence through South-South and triangular cooperation must be strengthened.
>
> *(Part III, Chapter 9)*
