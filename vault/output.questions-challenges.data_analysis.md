# DATA_ANALYSIS: Data analysis

## Sources and Questions

### UNCITIES21: Global environment outlook for cities – towards green and just cities (GEO for Cities)

**Question**: What tools and institutional capacities are needed to analyze and translate environmental and biodiversity data into actionable city decisions?

**Evidence**: “There are several examples of city governments that have responded to poor official data by developing their own common database, collecting and compiling all the relevant data housed in different departments... However, such an approach runs up against the additional challenge of dealing with the compartmentalization of government agencies and departments working in silos.” (Chapter 2, 2.3.3)
“Many of the insights needed to guide long-range planning and transformational pathways require specialist expertise that often does not sit within local governments. Expert guidance is often needed, for instance, to gather, process and interpret the data required for material flow analyses, greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity baselines and resilience assessments, among others.” (Summary for city-level decision makers, p. 11)

### UNLAND17_2: The Global Land Outlook: Part 2 - The Outlook

**Question**: What common standards and datasets are needed to assess dryland degradation and desertification consistently across regions and time?

**Evidence**: 

> Estimates of the extent of land degradation in the drylands differ considerably... The absence of a standard global assessment and monitoring system contributes to this variance and leads to a divergent understanding of land degradation and widely differing range of estimates.

### UNLAND17_1: The Global Land Outlook: Part 1 - The Big Picture

**Question**: What analytical approaches can meaningfully integrate complex, multi-scalar drivers into land degradation monitoring and interpretation?

**Evidence**: 

> In the past, land degradation maps have been controversial; their value questioned due to the multifaceted nature of the phenomenon, the complexity of processes involved, and the difficulty of interpretation at a global scale.
>
> *(Chapter 4, Box 4.1, p. 53)*

> The WAD implements a systematic and transparent framework to trace where the main human-environment processes and interactions coincide… This geographic convergence of evidence is instructive in that it highlights areas and possible pathways of land degradation…
>
> *(Chapter 4, Convergence of Evidence, p. 54)*

### EUECOSERVG2021: Ecosystem services accounting – part III

**Question**: How can ecosystem service accounts avoid double counting across vertical (supporting–final) and horizontal (inter-ecosystem) flows while maintaining completeness and comparability?

**Evidence**: “No ESs can be defined as intermediate by default. This definition depends on the assessment technique that is used. The risk of double counting can occur in different ways. Here, we identified two cases, which we named ‘vertical’ and ‘horizontal’, by following the structure of the ecosystem type supply table.” (Chapter 2.5)
“In the case of water purification, there are two stages of retaining pollutants: basin retention ... and river and lake retention... Basins play an important role and their role risks them being counted twice if aggregating two assessments that first consider basin retention only and then ... include basin retention again.” (Chapter 2.4.2)

### UNLEGAL: Environmental rule of law: tracking progress and charting future directions

**Question**: How can agencies and courts address data quality, interoperability and evidentiary concerns to utilize citizen-generated environmental data?

**Evidence**: “Despite its benefits… there are challenges with the adoption and implementation of citizen science. Some government agencies are hesitant to rely on citizen-generated data due to concerns about data quality, interoperability and consistency… In the courtroom, the issue largely turns on how the judge characterizes and evaluates the evidence, since the term ‘citizen science’ does not typically have a specific legal definition in the evidentiary context.” (Chapter 3, Section 3.3.2.3)

### NPOS25: Draft State of Nature Metrics

**Question**: How should trigger sensitivity, connectivity distances, and class definitions be analyzed to produce reliable, comparable state-of-nature signals?

**Evidence**:  

> Sensitivity of trigger approach and criteria... Definitions of 'surrounding area', land use classes, semi-natural habitat, core area, locally important species/ecosystems and connectivity distance.
>
> *(Technical questions for the pilots)*
