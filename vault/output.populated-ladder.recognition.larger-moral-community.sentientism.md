### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### UNESCOBIO11: Ethics and biodiversity

- **Organisation**: UNESCO
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the document explicitly discusses sentience and the extension of moral consideration to sentient beings (citing Singer and debates over moral agency), but it does not present codified policy mechanisms empowering sentient nonhumans within governance; the treatment is philosophical and comparative.

- Context/synthesis: The report introduces moral agency and sentience debates, citing Singer and linking to biodiversity ethics, showing explicit engagement with sentientist criteria: 

> It is widely argued that in order to have an interest in the result of action, the being should be sentient, able to experience pleasure and pain. A more stricter concept of a moral agent is a being that can make moral choices... in most arguments that promote the value of other animals as sentient beings (Singer, 1975) they compare attributes to elements that are found in Homo sapiens...
>
> *(2.9 Moral Agency)*


- Context/synthesis: The document connects sentientist perspectives to prioritization dilemmas in biodiversity decision-making, indicating implications without operational detail: 

> Even anthropocentric approaches have begun to recognize the intrinsic value of those species that possess sentience, such as higher vertebrates... The ethics of prioritization are the most difficult to contemplate, justify and even more so to communicate.
>
> *(2.10 Prioritization)*


- Context/synthesis: It frames conflicts between sentientist arguments and ecosystem-level considerations (e.g., evacuating great apes), showing the conceptual nature of the discourse: 

> Depending on the views taken we may prioritise certain sentient endangered species more highly than ecosystems and other organisms, and at some stage evacuate Great Apes out of habitats that are impossible to protect, for example.
>
> *(2.9 Moral Agency)*
