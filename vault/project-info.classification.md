# Classification Systems

## Overview

Each source is classified across three dimensions to distinguish opportunistic reports from sustained programmes and concrete proposals, while avoiding exclusion criteria that would eliminate early indicators of transformation.

## Table 3. Intent Categories

| Code | Category | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **E** | **Ethical and conceptual frameworks** | Foundational principles helping reframe stakeholders to include ecosystems, species, and technologies |
| **A** | **Aspirational declarations** | High-level goals and visions without specific mechanisms for implementation |
| **I** | **Implementation and metrics** | Participatory processes that simulate or proxy nonhuman perspectives, and indicators that evaluate impact on ecological/multispecies wellbeing not only human beneficiaries |
| **T** | **Technical assessments and evidence reviews** | Empirical analyses synthesising evidence for improved multispecies relationships |
| **P** | **Policy, legal and governance proposals** | Institutional mechanisms for more-than-human foresight in policy, education, and design, with binding or potentially binding implications |
| **S** | **Scenarios and futures exploration** | Alternative futures testing different degrees of multispecies collaboration |
| **R** | **Roadmaps and action plans** | Strategic pathways with timelines and actions for achieving transformation |
| **D** | **Destinations** | Proposed end-states and visions of transformed systems |

## Table 4. Mode of Production

| Score | Classification | Characteristics |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| **1** | **Individual expert authorship** | Limited peer validation; focused perspective; lower institutional impact |
| **2** | **2-10 specialist co-authors** | Combined expertise; coherent analysis; moderate consensus-building |
| **3** | **Major institutional reports (UN, IPBES)** | Systematic review; broad expert input; high institutional backing |
| **4** | **Structured participatory processes (10s-100s participants)** | Workshops, Delphi methods; integrate interdisciplinary perspectives, have generative capacity and evidence |

## Table 5. Author Discipline

| Classification | Fields Included | Contribution to More-than-Human Participation |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **STEM** | Natural sciences, ecology, biology, environmental science | Empirical evidence; quantitative data on nonhuman capabilities |
| **Social Science/Policy** | Economics, political science, governance, sociology | Institutional mechanisms; policy frameworks; transformation pathways |
| **Humanities/Ethics** | Philosophy, anthropology, ethics, cultural studies | Conceptual frameworks; ethical foundations; alternative worldviews |
| **Design/Engineering** | Design, architecture, engineering, technical innovation | Practical interventions; tools; spatial configurations |
| **Interdisciplinary** | Explicit integration across multiple fields | Synthetic approaches; bridging theory and practice |
| **Applied/Practice-Based** | Conservation practice, participatory methods, toolkits | Direct implementation; tested methodologies |

## Application

These classification systems help assess:
- **Signal strength**: Documents with higher production scores and institutional backing represent stronger signals
- **Disciplinary penetration**: Whether concepts remain confined to humanities or penetrate scientific and technical domains
- **Implementation readiness**: Intent categories distinguish between theoretical frameworks and actionable proposals
- **Legitimacy and rigour**: Mode of production indicates level of peer validation and institutional support

Together, this classification establishes a common framework that captures both weak signals emerging at the margins and strong signals backed by institutional authority.
