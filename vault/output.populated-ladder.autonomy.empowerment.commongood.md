# Common good

## Score 4: Actionable Mechanisms

*No sources at this score level*

## Score 3: Core Conceptual Device / Implications Explored

### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### COMESTWATER22: Report of COMEST on water ethics: ocean, freshwater and coastal areas

- **Organisation**: UNESCO COMEST
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the common good is treated as a central political-ethical construct applied to oceans and water as global commons with detailed implications (UNCLOS, London/OSPAR, MPA design, equitable use), informing goals, trade-offs, and criteria, although not packaged as a single enforceable political program of 'commoning'. 

- Water and oceans are framed as common goods for all living beings and ecosystems: 

> Water is the common good of all living beings and ecosystems, and global commons include the high seas.
>
> *(VI.3 Common Good)*


- They connect the common good to legal regimes and precaution: 

> The London and the OSPAR conventions… appealing to a precautionary approach in recognizing that even though there might be no direct scientific evidence that the waste had had any impact… preventative measures are taken when there is reason to believe that wastes… are likely to cause harm.
>
> *(II.3 Ocean Governance)*


- They analyze governance tensions and propose design considerations (e.g., MPAs, high seas freedom vs. commons): 

> There are several ethical dilemmas associated with the designation of MPAs… whether… it is more appropriate to protect the entire ocean with global rules and regulation.
>
> *(II.4 Case Study 1)*


- The report articulates distributive and procedural implications of the common good: 

> human beings are required to protect the natural environment of the planet as their heritage… best understood as a trust… the beneficiaries are not only those currently alive but future generations, and not only future human generations but other species as well.
>
> *(VI.3; citing Attfield, 2003)*

### IMPLEMENTATION AND METRICS

#### D4C25: Design for Environmental Conservation (Toolkit)

- **Organisation**: None
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Design/Engineering

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the book explicitly invokes commons as a moral and governance lens and uses it to frame participatory, co-stewarded resources and responsibilities, applying it to method design and stakeholder roles, though not proposing a specific commoning statute. 

- Commons foundation: “The concept of the commons refers to a set of resources shared by a community, collectively managed to ensure equitable and sustainable use… Participatory methodologies are vital… returning agency to local and Indigenous communities.” (Ch.3)

- Implications for governance: “Participatory governance models that include community consultation and decentralized decision-making can lead to conservation practices that are not only effective but also deeply rooted in the communities they aim to serve.” (Ch.3)

- Tools aligning with common good: “Stakeholder Motivation Matrix… align stakeholders around shared goals… Sustainable Growth Plan (SLOC) supports distributed, decentralized scaling.” (Ch.10)

- Criteria and indicators: “Impact Planning… Advanced Impact Planning Canvas aligning with SDG metrics… Sustainability Radar… context-based regeneration.” (Ch.9)

## Score 2: Theoretical Treatment

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### EURIGHTS: Towards an EU Charter of the Fundamental Rights of Nature

- **Organisation**: EESC
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the 'common good' appears as a conceptual/policy reference supporting the Charter’s direction (e.g., Economy for the Common Good, Ethical Trade Zone), but is not elaborated into a standalone governance model within the EU proposal.

- Explicit reference and implication: 

> Christian Felber, founder of the social international movement of the 'Economy for the Common Good', suggests the creation of an 'Ethical Trade Zone'... If the EU introduced a Charter on the Rights of Nature, it would become the first organization in the world to create a new dimension of supranational coexistence, in harmony with the Earth system.

## Score 1: Token Acknowledgement

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### IPBESTCA2: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 2. Visions of a sustainable world – for nature and people

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because the common good is mentioned within an alternative economic vision (Dasgupta), but not developed further.

- Common good is referenced in framing economics of biodiversity: 

> It emphasizes humans embedded in nature, including the entire biosphere and human ingenuity focused on the common good without transgressing biosphere boundaries.
>
> *(Table 2.1)*


- Prevents higher score: no elaboration on common-good institutions or procedures in this chapter.
