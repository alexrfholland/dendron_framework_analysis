### EUNATURERIGHTS21: Can nature get it right? Rights of Nature in the European context

**Question**: How to remedy the EU-level access-to-justice deficit identified by the Aarhus Compliance Committee (C/32) while preserving the EU’s judicial architecture?

**Evidence**: “the Aarhus Convention’s Compliance Committee... criticises the strict criteria in EU law which apply when someone wants to challenge decisions... by the EU institution by instigating legal action direct to the CJEU... the Compliance Committee found the criteria for direct access to the CJEU too strict.” (4.5 Direct action to the CJEU)
“the European Commission published a proposal for revision of the Aarhus Regulation... to amend the Regulation in a way that is compatible with the fundamental principles of the Union legal order... ENGOs should be awarded broader possibilities to challenge acts and omissions of EU bodies.” (4.5 Direct action to the CJEU)
