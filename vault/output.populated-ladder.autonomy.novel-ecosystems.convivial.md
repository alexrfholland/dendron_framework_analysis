# Convivial conservation

## Score 4: Actionable Mechanisms

### SCENARIOS AND FUTURES EXPLORATION

#### NEHALF20: Narratives for the Half Earth and Sharing the Planet scenarios

- **Organisation**: PBL
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because the report uses Convivial Conservation as the foundational governance model for the Sharing the Planet scenario and details actionable political and institutional mechanisms (e.g., reparations, conservation basic income, rethinking corporate relations, coalitions, democratic settings), specifying steps and targets that could be implemented. 

- Foundational mechanism for SP governance: “the SP scenario draws on... Convivial Conservation... authors maintain that a new type of conservation... must go beyond the human–nature dichotomy.” (3.2.2)

- Specific implementation proposals: “Historic reparations... a conservation basic income (CBI)... Rethinking relationships to corporations... Creation of a Convivial Conservation Coalition... Rethinking democratic settings... Alternative funding mechanisms.” (5.3)

- Power/actor focus and rebalancing: “they identify... Rural lower classes... Urban... Land-owning capitalist classes... Global upper classes... State... effective conservation governance starts ‘by addressing actors in the superordinate levels... then work down towards the local people’.” (5.3)

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### SCTRANSS25: Environment strategy for Scotland – transformative changes for sustainability

- **Organisation**: Scottish Government
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because convivial conservation is advanced as a core management framework with explicit strategies (e.g., reparations, conservation basic income, degrowth-oriented governance), considering implications and consequences, though with fewer Scotland-specific implementation details.

- The report sets out strategic pillars and instruments for convivial conservation: 

> Convivial conservation promotes public and community solutions instead of market based ones... Key propositions include... transitioning tourism... longer-term engagement with the ‘wild’... governance arrangements moving away from privatised conservation expert technocracy to common democratic engagement... Strategies include historic reparations, strengthening social movements, a conservation basic income, rethinking relations with companies, redirecting integrated conservation landscapes to degrowth and wealth sharing, effective polycentric governance and engaging asset holders, redistributive finance.
>
> *(7.3 Social and cultural policy instruments)*


- It links convivial conservation to post-growth and wealth sharing outcomes that favour nonhuman autonomy and flourishing, clarifying intended goals: 

> ...redirecting integrated conservation landscapes to degrowth and wealth sharing... enabling all people to live with nature.
>
> *(7.3)*


- The report acknowledges implementation challenges (path dependencies, endangered species risks), showing awareness of consequences and trade-offs: 

> Such approaches must overcome path dependencies... and immediate concerns about losses of endangered species.

> *(7.3)*
