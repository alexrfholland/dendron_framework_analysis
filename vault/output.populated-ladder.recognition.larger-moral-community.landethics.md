## Score 4: Actionable Mechanisms

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### UNLANDETHICS: Concept note of the World Commission on the Ethics of Scientific Knowledge and Technology (COMEST) on land-use ethics

- **Organisation**: UNESCO COMEST
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because the report adopts land ethics (Leopold and successors) as a foundational framework, develops guiding principles (solidarity, environmental justice, sustainability, prevention of harm, diversity, gender) and provides concrete, actionable recommendations to Member States on governance, science-policy, and participation for land-use, thereby operationalizing the framework. - It centers land ethics conceptually and normatively: 

> Aldo Leopold’s essay, ‘The Land Ethic’ is a seminal work... Leopold formulated the following key principle... ‘A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise’.
>
> *(III.1 Ethical Frameworks and Perspectives)*

 - It extends land ethics to policy guidance and governance: “COMEST suggests that different perspectives from environmental ethics, land ethics, and development ethics can inform the debate on land use.” (I.4) and then provides “PART IV: RECOMMENDATIONS” (Governance; Scientific Knowledge; Participation) to implement these principles. - Actionable recommendations provide concrete steps: “For land use to become sustainable, fair and transparent policies are required regarding ownership of and access to land... Integrated landscape management should identify and respect the multi-functionality of landscapes... UN Agencies should include sustainable land use as a global priority.” (Part IV: Recommendations) - It sets criteria, outcomes and negotiation strategies (environmental justice procedural rights, Free Prior Informed Consent, inclusion of indigenous knowledge): 

> Policy makers and corporations should allow meaningful public participation... The public should have access to relevant and timely information and be consulted... They also need access to independent legal advice... to realize free informed consent... citizens and communities should not be deprived of all the relevant information.

### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### UNESCOBIO11: Ethics and biodiversity

- **Organisation**: UNESCO
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because Leopold’s Land Ethic is explicitly discussed as a named ethical framework with significant implications for biodiversity and ecosystem integrity, but the text remains expository and does not translate land ethics into specific institutional mandates or legal mechanisms within the report’s scope.

- Context/synthesis: The report quotes and contextualizes Leopold’s famous normative criterion linking biodiversity integrity and beauty, showing the conceptual framing: 

> Many environmentalists have invoked the ‘beauty of biodiversity’, perhaps most famously Aldo Leopold, ‘a thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise’.
>
> *(3.1.3 Aesthetic Value)*


- Context/synthesis: It highlights obstacles in adopting a land ethic, pointing to societal and political barriers, underscoring that the framework is presented as a guiding ideal rather than operational policy in the report: 

> Leopold also points to the attitude of the farmer, which views nature as an adversary to be tamed... another of Leopold’s ideas... misperception of the common citizen that scientists thoroughly understand nature... may play an important role when public opinion is crafted on matters of ethics...
>
> *(2.13 Obstacles)*


- Context/synthesis: The text also links land-ethic-aligned concerns (ecosystem integrity, biodiversity at landscape scale) to policy debates (e.g., geo-engineering moratoriums), but does not give detailed governance steps: 

> The dangers of such actions have been recognized and recommendations for moratoriums on geo-engineering have been sent for consideration.
>
> *(2.5 Ecocentrism)*
