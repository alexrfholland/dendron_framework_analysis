# Challenge Categories

## Overview

During analysis, we extracted key challenges and open questions that sources identify as preventing advancement in more-than-human participation. These challenges represent barriers to transformation and areas requiring future research and development.

## Challenge Categories

| Code | Challenge Category | Description |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| **COMM_BARRIERS** | **Communication barriers** | Communication barriers between disparate human groups and nonhuman agents at organism, holobiont and collective levels |
| **WORLDVIEW_INCOMP** | **Worldview incompatibilities** | Disparate and sometimes incompatible worldviews and epistemologies |
| **KNOWLEDGE_GAPS** | **Knowledge gaps** | Lack of shared knowledge bases and challenges in knowledge accrual |
| **SCI_DEBATES** | **Scientific debates** | Ongoing debates in the scientific community regarding mechanisms of evolution, development, health and wellbeing |
| **LIVING_SYS_UNKNOWNS** | **Living systems unknowns** | Lack of knowledge about living systems at multiple levels |
| **INTERDIS_BARRIERS** | **Interdisciplinary barriers** | Steep learning curves and other barriers that restrict interdisciplinary collaboration such as difficulties in making ecological knowledge accessible to designers and engineers |
| **INSTIT_GAPS** | **Institutional gaps** | Lack of shared institutional structures including societies, industrial bodies, standards and educational certifications |
| **ETHICAL_UNRESOLVED** | **Unresolved ethical challenges** | Ethical challenges without satisfactory resolutions |
| **POWER_DYNAMICS** | **Power dynamics** | Power dynamics and political struggles including perceived or actual loss of cultural or monetary capital |
| **CULTURAL_ACCEPT** | **Cultural acceptance** | Cultural acceptance of alternative lifestyles such as the need to redefine human aesthetic or hygiene expectations |
| **SYSTEMATIC_BIAS** | **Systematic bias** | Biases that are difficult or impossible to avoid without systematic enforcement |
| **HIGH_COSTS** | **High costs** | High costs associated with participatory approaches |
| **TIME_INTENSIVE** | **Time requirements** | Greater time required for participatory approaches |
| **RISK_AVERSION** | **Risk aversion** | Participatory design's tendency to avoid risky, unusual or radical solutions |
| **DATA_COLLECTION** | **Data collection difficulties** | Difficulty in collecting on-demand data |
| **DATA_ANALYSIS** | **Data analysis challenges** | Difficulty in analysing and interpreting data |
| **TOOL_GAPS** | **Tooling gaps** | Lack of tooling |
| **QUANT_DATA_NEEDS** | **Quantitative data needs** | The need for quantitative data in design and engineering which often differs in kind, resolution or continuity from data collected by ecologists and biologists |
| **PRECEDENT_GAPS** | **Precedent gaps** | Lack of examples, comparative analyses, training, common discussion forums |
| **EFFICIENCY_CONCERNS** | **Efficiency concerns** | Efficiency concerns regarding carbon emissions, costs and effort invested into location- or time-bound projects |
| **RISK_BENEFIT** | **Risk-benefit relationships** | Risk and benefit relationships |
| **COMPLEX_UNPRED** | **Complex unpredictability** | Inherent unpredictability of complex systems |
| **SCALING_CHALLENGES** | **Scaling challenges** | Difficulty and problematic implications of scaling up local solutions |
| **NATURE_DISCONNECT** | **Nature disconnection** | Disconnection between humans and other living communities leading to the loss of relational and processual knowledge ('disconnection from nature') |
| **TECH_FLUIDITY** | **Technology fluidity** | The pervasive impact and fluidity of technology ('relational perspective on emergent technology') |
| **EVIDENCE_PROD** | **Evidence production** | Production of evidence |
| **EVIDENCE_PRACTICE** | **Evidence to practice** | Translation of evidence into practice |

## Usage in Analysis

These challenge categories were used to:
- **Extract challenges** explicitly raised by sources
- **Identify knowledge gaps** preventing more-than-human participation
- **Map barriers** to transformation across ladder rungs
- **Highlight research needs** for future investigation

## Analytical Approach

- **Source-driven**: Challenges must be explicitly discussed in sources, not inferred
- **Evidence-based**: Each challenge includes supporting quotes from source documents
- **Systematic**: Consistent application across all 69 sources
- **Open coding**: Additional categories captured as 'other_{category}' when sources raised important challenges not covered by predefined categories
