### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### ROMEECO22: Transforming our economies from ego to eco

- **Organisation**: Club of Rome
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the document operationalizes a workshop practice (Social Presencing Theater) that assigns explicit roles to 'voices of Mother Earth', thus simulating nonhuman perspectives in decision-oriented processes; implications and applications are discussed across training, leadership, and systems change, but not codified into governance law (conceptual/practical, not statutory).

- The method explicitly introduces a nonhuman 'voice' in co-creative system mapping with large-scale application: 

> For example, we use Social Presencing Theater as an intuitive way of mapping the invisible deep structures of systems change (Hayashi, 2021). The stakeholders vary with the context, but three roles are always present: the voices of Mother Earth, of the most marginalised (in each system), and of the emerging future (children or future generations).

- The practice is embedded in the broader 'U Process' used to structure change initiatives and leadership development:

 and linked to

- The implications of including nonhuman voices are tied to systems sensing and listening shifts that influence outcomes and negotiation strategies: 

> The key to making multi-stakeholder collaborations work lies in shifting the members’ mindsets from a silo to a systems view … That happens when the system learns to sense and see itself.

> The first and most actionable shift towards profound systems change is often at the interpersonal level – in how we listen and how we hold conversations.

### IMPLEMENTATION AND METRICS

#### DBIO23: Integrating biodiversity in urban development

- **Organisation**: None
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the paper explicitly recommends nonhuman personas as a core technique within Biodiversity Inclusive Design for representing species’ needs in design, and discusses implications for cohabitation and empathy, though it does not provide a standardized persona template. 

- Method endorsement: “These species act as non-human personas allowing designers to explicitly think about species’ interaction with the urban landscape and its human citizens and design for human & non-human cohabitation.” (4.3)

- Implications for practice: Personas are part of BID’s aim “to ‘listen’ and understand what different species... need from the urban landscape,” informing design decisions and evaluation. (4.3)

- Link to practice examples: The review references multispecies/animal-aided design cases (e.g., zoo enrichment, wildlife-inclusive design), situating personas within a suite of participatory tools designers can apply. (1; 3.2; 4.3)
