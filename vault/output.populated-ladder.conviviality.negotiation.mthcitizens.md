### IMPLEMENTATION AND METRICS

#### DBIO23: Integrating biodiversity in urban development

- **Organisation**: None
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the paper conceptually positions biodiversity as 'non-human citizens' and 'active citizens' of cities and considers the implications for design and governance (participation continuum), but does not create binding civic/legal institutions for nonhuman citizenship. 

- Citizenship claim: “Within the context of urban design and development, ‘biodiversity’ can be considered as many non-human citizens living in a particular locality. They are also active citizens; where different species respond to and change their direct surroundings.” (1. Introduction)

- Participation implications: “The three roles... passive, incidental, and active... are determined by the ‘level’... to which biodiversity informs design thinking and decision-making within development processes.” (3.1)

- Political dimension noted as a developing frontier: “the language in the Arnstein ladder implies a political dimension that is not as explicitly adopted in biodiversity design approaches... suggests a direction for future research, where the proposed roles for biodiversity are discussed in line with specific ‘rungs’ on the ladder.” (4.1)

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### UNCITIES21: Global environment outlook for cities – towards green and just cities (GEO for Cities)

- **Organisation**: UNEP & UN-Habitat
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the report provides explicit political recognition mechanisms (citizenship) for nonhumans with case evidence and discusses implications for land-use and management, but treats them as exemplars rather than a citywide mandate, hence not a fully specified institutional framework across contexts.

- Concrete political mechanism: 

> Curridabat’s innovative 'Sweet City' urban plan highlights the critical role of pollinators, which are recognized as official citizens of the city alongside their plants and trees (Greenfield 2020; Kitchen 2020).
>
> *(Chapter 4, 4.2.3)*


- Implementation/criteria: 

> Oslo’s bee highway is designed to provide pollinator pathways through the city ... 'precautionary zones' where wild bees may need additional protection in the future through the addition of flowering plants.
>
> *(Chapter 4, Figure 4.3; Stange et al. 2017)*


- Implications for planning and equity: 

> Such large-scale landscape interventions may provide opportunities to design city wildland buffers both to protect animals from human intrusion and to protect people from the dangers of the presence of wildlife, such as attacks and disease transmission.
>
> *(Chapter 4, 4.2.3)*
