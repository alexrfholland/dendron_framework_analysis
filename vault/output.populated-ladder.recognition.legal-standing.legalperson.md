# Legal personhood

## Score 4: Actionable Mechanisms

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### IPBESTCA3: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 3. How transformative change occurs

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because the chapter presents legal personhood for nonhuman entities as an actionable legal tool embedded in multi-approach strategies, with concrete case mechanisms (Te Urewera, Whanganui, Mar Menor, marine turtles), governance structures, and outcomes. - Context/synthesis: Detailed cases show personhood enacted in statute, with institutional roles and ripple effects; it is not merely theoretical. 

> Te Urewera received legal personhood in 2014, and... the Whanganui River which received these rights in 2017... In 2022, the Mar Menor lagoon in Spain became the first ecosystem in Europe with its own legal personality... in 2023, marine turtles were granted legal personhood in Panama and in the Loyalty Islands.
>
> *(Box 3.1, p. 113-114)*


- Context/synthesis: The Te Awa Tupua framework is mapped to actors (Indigenous Peoples, governments, civil society, lawyers), actions (laws/regulations change), and scaling (global uptake), providing a governance playbook. 

> Ripple effect across the world for the recognition of legal rights to natural entities... aligning traditional and contemporary processes with resource outcomes priorities.
>
> *(Figure 3.3 legend, p. 115)*


- Context/synthesis: The chapter also critically examines representation challenges and potential perverse effects, demonstrating engagement with implications and safeguards. 

> Such legal actions could even have perverse influences on Indigenous identities and agendas.
>
> *(Box 3.1, p. 114)*

#### EUSTI50: S&T&I for 2050: science, technology and innovation for ecosystem performance – accelerating sustainability transitions

- **Organisation**: EC DG R&I
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because legal personhood for nature is developed with concrete institutional forms, case law, and procedural designs (e.g., guardianship councils, representation bodies like the Parliament of the Loire), plus policy steps to embed these forms in European law and practice; the chapter also models implications and scenarios including governance, enforcement, and budgeting.

- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> A range of legislative and constitutional acts... afford natural entities the status of 'legal personhood' for legal proceedings. These changes are intended to give standing to interested parties representing or acting as guardians... Examples: Aotearoa New Zealand, legal personhood of the Whanganui River under guardianship of a joint council; Te Urewara... India... Uganda... Bangladesh...
>
> *(4.1.2 Rights of Nature applications)*


- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> One strategy might entail extending rights directly to biological entities (species or ecosystems)... challenges... how to non‑arbitrarily decide on the appropriate biological or ecological group to which to recognise rights... Ultimately, rights of nature proponents argue that granting nature legal personhood is essential to combating the disastrous effects...
>
> *(4.1.2 Limitations)*


- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> The movement of the Loire Parliament consults among relevant stakeholders and explores proposals for potential governance procedures and structures that could ensure the river’s interest in the long‑term.
>
> *(4.1.2 Limitations; illustration)*


- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> European environmental law centres on the polluter pays and precautionary principles... Procedurally, EU ascension into the Aarhus Convention... access to environmental justice... Environmental Ombudspersons at the EU and national levels capable and in separate institutions to bring environmental cases to court.
>
> *(4.1.2 European Environmental Law; 4.1.2 Benefits)*


- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Governments, private sector actors and communities have developed adaptive, innovative consent‑based approaches to establishing regional economic zones based on ecosystem functions... Goals for ecosystem health have transitioned... Widespread implementation of rights of nature supports the introduction of new practice for co‑shaping – for negotiation human and non‑human interests and values.

#### UNLEGAL: Environmental rule of law: tracking progress and charting future directions

- **Organisation**: UNEP
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because legal personhood for nonhumans is extensively applied with clear institutional mechanisms (guardianship offices, court-designated representatives, open standing), concrete jurisprudence, and governance structures that can be implemented; the report details implementation consequences, remedies, and role assignments in practice.

- Multiple jurisdictions operationalize personhood with formal representation: 

> In New Zealand, the state declared the Whanganui River to be a legal person... The Te Awa Pua (Whanganui River Claims Settlement) Act created a new office, Te Pou Tupua, to act and speak for the river, with two individuals nominated...
>
> *(Chapter 4, Section 4.3.5)*


- Courts extend personhood to ecosystems and animals with consequences for enforcement: 

> In 2020, the Punjab and Haryana High Court of India held the Sukhna Lake to be a living entity with rights of a legal person... The same year, the Islamabad High Court recognized the legal personhood of an elephant... In 2021, a U.S. District Court recognized a group of hippos... as ‘interested persons’ for the purpose of taking depositions...
>
> *(Chapter 4, Section 4.3.5)*


- Concrete assignment of guardianship and institutional authority: 

> In Bangladesh, the Supreme Court ordered the National River Protection Commission to serve as the guardian for rivers in the country, under the parens patriae doctrine...
>
> *(Chapter 4, Section 4.3.5)*


- Practical enforcement pathways and standing: 

> Another option is to allow any person to bring a case on behalf of nature through an open standing provision. This is the approach employed in the Uganda National Environmental Act.
>
> *(Chapter 4, Section 4.3.5)*


- Detailed implications for governance choices and design trade-offs: 

> Recognizing rights of nature raises some practical questions, including who represents the interests of nature and how those rights are exercised and protected. Different jurisdictions have taken different approaches...
>
> *(Chapter 4, Section 4.3.5)*


- Outcomes and indicators (orders, restoration, regulatory redesign) demonstrate criteria for success: 

> It [Ecuador’s Constitutional Court] ordered the state-owned mining company and other companies to stop all mining activities... remove associated infrastructure and restore forested areas affected... [and ordered] the government to... adopt regulations relating to issuance of environmental and water licenses and develop a participatory plan...
>
> *(Chapter 4, Section 4.3.5)*

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### EURIGHTS: Towards an EU Charter of the Fundamental Rights of Nature

- **Organisation**: EESC
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because the study explicitly proposes granting legal personality to Nature and details operational mechanisms (standing, guardianship, Ombudsman/Amicus Naturae, reversal of burden of proof) to enact and enforce this status within EU law and courts.

- Clear legal personality proposal and consequences: 

> First and foremost, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of Nature will grant legal personality to Nature. Autonomous rights (e.g. not dependent on human rights) will be conferred to Nature. Therefore, the protection of Nature, ecosystems and more generally the environment will be considered an obligation at the EU 'constitutional' level.
>
> *(Section 5.5, p. 69)*


- Standing and representation mechanisms are specified: 

> Giving rights to nature means recognizing Nature as a legal entity... possible actions to protect the Rights of Nature should take into account three compatibility parameters... access to justice (Articles 263, 264, 265 TFEU; Aarhus Convention)... possible establishment of ‘Amicus Naturae’ and the Ombudsman empowerment to promptly investigate serious environmentally related Rights of Nature infringements.
>
> *(Section 6.3, p. 97; Section 4.4 Milestone 6, p. 55)*


- Procedural tools and burden of proof are detailed: 

> The rule of five responsibilities towards Nature, with reversal of the burden of proof... Since Nature is a living but voiceless entity, the only effective way to protect it is by reversing the burden of proof... The reversal of the burden of proof... allows an assertion of a presumption of harm.
>
> *(Section 5.6.5, p. 84-86)*


- Concrete policy/legal pathways (Treaty amendment or inter-institutional act) and EU-wide applicability are provided: 

> The study recommends two possible legal pathways... 1) Incorporation into the EU treaties... or 2) Adoption as an inter-institutional non-legislative act...
>
> *(Executive Summary, p. 8; Section 7.1, p. 116-118)*

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### SCTRANSS25: Environment strategy for Scotland – transformative changes for sustainability

- **Organisation**: Scottish Government
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because legal personhood is presented as an actionable element of the RoN agenda (e.g., 

> naturehood to persons

), with concrete devices such as guardianship, courts, and charters, and with specific political and legal processes to implement in national contexts.

- The report proposes concrete steps to adopt personhood for nature as part of national legal reform: 

> Rights of Nature ... explore options for nationally supporting measures on rights of nature – for example, including naturehood to persons, ecocide, plus restorative justice and environmental courts.
>
> *(7.2 Legal and regulatory policy instruments)*


- It details operational mechanisms, such as appointing legal guardians and creating local charters, to give effect to personhood: 

> Nine rights were granted [to the Magpie River], including the right to be safe from pollution, the right to be safe from pollution and the right to sue, and the ability to assign legal guardians to ensure rights are respected... a campaign has got underway to grant the River Ouse legal rights of nature... and a charter is under development.
>
> *(Box 7: Examples of Rights of Nature)*


- The report links personhood to institutional capacity-building and public access to justice to enable enforcement: 

> Ensure transparency and accountability mechanisms e.g. public hearings, environmental ombudspersons to enable public access to relevant information.
>
> *(Table 3 – Legal and regulatory policy instruments)*


- It also references ongoing UK efforts (even if unsuccessful), mapping out strategies, actors, and barriers, which helps translation to practice: 

> There have been two attempts to grant legal personhood to nonhuman animals in UK Parliament... one effort was made to give a UK river – the River Frome – such rights... More recently, a campaign has got underway to grant the River Ouse legal rights of nature...
>
> *(Box 7: Examples of Rights of Nature)*

## Score 3: Core Conceptual Device / Implications Explored

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### NZOCEAN21: The breaking wave: reforming the oceans management system in Aotearoa New Zealand

- **Organisation**: Environmental Defence Society
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because legal personhood is explicitly proposed as a concrete institutional option (e.g., a body to speak as the legal 'voice' of te moana), and the report works through implications and governance consequences for oceans, but stops short of a fully detailed statutory design with steps. 

- Concept introduced as a core normative tool with strategic implications: 

> Deploying tools/mechanisms like legal personhood for nature, or putting a price on the natural world, requires us first to think deeply about potentially conflicting worldviews (is it right to treat nature as a commodity? Is it naïve to think of the oceans as a non-human person?).
>
> *(Chapter 1.6 Norms)*


- Used to develop an institutional outcome to ensure multispecies representation in governance: 

> Going further, should society build institutions that give the oceans a voice of their own? Can this build on the innovative legal personhood developed as part of the settlement processes for Te Urewera and Te Awa Tupua/Whanganui River... what would be the challenges in giving the oceans as a whole legal personhood (eg through recognition as Tangaroa or Hinemoana)?
>
> *(Chapter 4.8)*


- Governance design implication: 

> An Oceans Commission or similar could be constituted as a national oceans co-governance body with iwi... It could even be a vehicle through which te moana is given legal personhood (with the Commission being the voice of te moana).
>
> *(Chapter 7.3 Options)*


- Criteria for success/negotiation strategy tied to personhood and koha: 

> Instead of a resource rental going back into the public purse, should that be treated as 'payment' or koha to nature for its services (or compensation for past harm) and be invested in regeneration projects?
>
> *(Chapter 4.8)*

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### STOCK50: Stockholm+50: unlocking a better future

- **Organisation**: SEI & CEEW
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because legal personhood for nature is explicitly proposed as part of the Rights of Nature rationale with specific institutional implications (judicial/legislative consideration, enforcement capacity), making it central to the report’s legal transformation pathway though without prescriptive legislative drafting.

- Context/synthesis: The document urges the articulation of nature’s personhood within human-rights frameworks, signaling a foundational shift in legal standing that states can operationalize. 

> The Human Right to clean, safe and sustainable environment should incorporate a Rights of Nature rationale, whereby human responsibility and interests for the protection of Nature as a legal entity with personhood are clearly articulated.
>
> *(Recommendations – Recognize Indigenous local knowledge and the Rights of Nature)*


- Context/synthesis: It recommends national-level consideration and stakeholder consultations toward establishing such status, indicating a structured policy process. 

> National legislative and judicial bodies should consider whether establishing Rights of Nature will help protect nature in specific contexts, based on comprehensive consultation with stakeholders and analysis of what capacities and resources would be needed for effective enforcement.
>
> *(Recommendations – Recognize Indigenous local knowledge and the Rights of Nature)*

## Score 2: Theoretical Treatment

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### EUINVASIVE24: IPBES Invasive Alien Species Assessment: Chapter 1. Introducing Biological Invasions and the IPBES Thematic Assessment of Invasive Alien Species and Their Control

- **Organisation**: Roy
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the chapter engages with legal personality conceptually as part of ethical debates on IAS management (rights of animals and nature), considering conflicts between individual and species interests, without proposing concrete legal mechanisms specific to IAS in this chapter.

- Context/synthesis: The role of legal rights and personality is discussed in weighing moral limits and conflicts in IAS control. “The extension of legal rights to animals and nature imposes moral and legal limits on acceptable human uses of the environment, and if the legal personality of both ecosystems and individual animals is acknowledged, the interests of individual animals may conflict with interests of individual species, as can be the case with native and invasive alien species.” (Section 1.5.3)

- Context/synthesis: The chapter frames rights as one dimension of ethical evaluation alongside stakeholder values and animal welfare. “Deciding whether and how to control invasive alien species involves analysing risks, and considering international consensus principles for ethical wildlife control... proponents of compassionate conservation state that humans should do no harm and consider that individual animals matter.” (Section 1.5.3)

#### EUHRPLAN21: Human rights for the planet

- **Organisation**: Council of Europe
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because legal personhood for nature is explicitly presented and considered via multiple international examples (rivers and Mother Earth constitutional provisions) and its implications for European human rights are discussed, but it remains comparative/theoretical with no operational mechanism adopted in Europe to empower nonhumans.

- Explicit listing of legal personhood cases: 

> We all know about the attribution of legal personality to exotic rivers and forests, or Mother Nature... Recognition of Ganges and Yamana rivers as juridical persons... recognition of legal personhood of the Atrato River and Amazon Forest, see, respectively Centro de Estudios... ‘Atrato River Case’; ... ‘Amazon Case’; Constitutions of Bolivia and Ecuador that create a new political and legal subject: nature – Pachamama -Mother Earth.
>
> *(Overview of ECtHR environmental case-law)*


- Use of personhood examples to frame European questions on ecocentrism and standing: 

> But what happens if non-State actors want to protect nature or the environment? It is true that the Court has recognised nature protection as a legitimate public interest to be defended by environmental activists... But an ‘interest’ is not the same as a ‘right’ which brings me to the next topic.
>
> *(Overview of ECtHR environmental case-law)*

#### EUONEHEALTH24: One Health governance in the European Union

- **Organisation**: SAPEA
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because legal personhood for nonhumans is explicitly discussed with substantive examples and implications (guardianship and obligations), but the report does not specify actionable EU legislative mechanisms to institute personhood.

- The report uses a concrete international example illustrating the consequences of personhood (guardianship, duty to manage health) for a nonhuman entity: 

> For example, the Whanganui River in New Zealand was granted legal personhood in 2017, obliging both governmental and local guardians to manage the river’s health in a way that considers its ecological, cultural, and social importance.
>
> *(EU policies – Legal right to One Health?)*


- It argues for the potential importance of similar frameworks in the EU, indicating a direction of travel and governance implications: 

> ‘Wider recognition of Indigenous worldviews and customary legal systems in determining the legal personhood of more-than-human beings […] is essential to safeguard against the pitfalls of categorisation, homogenisation, and the imposition of dominant norms’... may become more important in the EU...
>
> *(EU policies – Legal right to One Health?)*


- It frames personhood within a broader One Health jurisprudence context that would rebalance anthropocentric law, but without detailing EU codification steps: 

> There is potential for One Health (‘earth’) jurisprudence, which recognises that legal frameworks need to extend beyond Western legal ideals to embed diverse cultural, Indigenous and philosophical perspectives.
>
> *(EU policies – Summary/Key findings)*

#### IPBSVALUES22: Summary for policymakers of the methodological assessment of the diverse values and valuation of nature

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the text mentions legal personhood implicitly through rights of specific natural entities (rivers, lakes, mountains) and links it to embedding values, but does not provide detailed mechanisms or case design in the SPM. - The assessment references legal recognition for natural entities: “Different rights-based approaches... rights of specific entities like rivers, lakes, mountains.” (D2) - It implies the role of such instruments in value-embedding and transformation: “Reforming policy in order to realign incentives, rights, and legal regulations with the diverse values of nature...” (KM9)

### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### ZOO23: Looking at Individual Interests beyond Species Conservation in Zoos.

- **Organisation**: Clay
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Humanities/Ethics

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because legal personhood is mentioned as an emerging topic (personhood and agency) without substantive engagement or application to practice in the article.

- Context/synthesis: Personhood is flagged as increasingly relevant to ethical debates over captive individual interests. “Finally, questions of personhood, agency, individual rights are becoming more and more relevant in light of ethological studies that highlight individual animal interests, emotions, and experiences.” (Main text)
