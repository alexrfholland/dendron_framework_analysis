**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because speculative design is advanced as a core practice to prefigure more-than-human futures, with explicit mechanisms (arts programmes, public engagement, world-building) and clear implications for governance and strategy.

- The report sets out speculative fabulation and arts as tools for imagining multispecies futures and informing strategy: 

> By speculating and perhaps prefiguring such futures in practice, this can inform broader governmental and other actors’ strategies and actions for flourishing earthly life.
>
> *(Foreword)*


- It offers concrete supports and venues to implement speculative practice: 

> Support speculative futures exploration by artists and environmental humanities... arts-based and participatory engagement of local communities in collective action.
>
> *(Table 3: Radical and speculative future-making)*


- It demonstrates how speculative platforms (e.g., Afrofuturism, Indigenous futurism, Embassy of the North Sea) contribute to nonhuman voice and representation, linking concept to practice outcomes: 

> Art can also support human capacity to respond to unrelatable stories... recognising longer than human lifespans, animal sentience... Artists... can contribute to eliciting and re-imagining futures... enabling nature to speak in the active voice.
>
> *(7.3 Social and cultural policy instruments)*


- It discusses the implications for policy design (beyond scenario modelling), clarifying the consequences of adopting speculative methods: 

> Dominant forms of futures exploration advance certain interests... risk of modelling and scenarios is that they advance... assumptions... support a wider range of potential futures...
>
> *(7.3)*
