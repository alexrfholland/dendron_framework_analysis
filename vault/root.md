# More-than-Human Participation Analysis

## Overview

This workspace contains **62 innovations** (frameworks) from the More-than-Human Participation scoping review.

**Analysis Date:** 2025-09-15
**Sources Analyzed:** 69

## Methods

We use the Ladder of More-than-Human Participation to structure this horizon scan, adapting the EuroScan protocol (Guti√©rrez-Ibarluzea et al., 2014; Hines et al., 2019). We first define a series of innovations of the transformed system, structured by ladder rungs. We then search for and assess signals coming from practice of these innovations to assess transformation in action. To do so, we:

1. **Define weak signals** as indicators of transformation, treating documents from governance and practice as early signals of change that form patterns when viewed through the Ladder framework.
2. **Define innovations** emerging from research relevant to each rung of the Ladder to empirically ground the framework and relate approaches across intersecting worldviews, perspectives, disciplines, and practices.
3. **Search for signals** of these innovations in practice through Overton.io, using broad terms to map the landscape and targeted searches to amplify higher-rung activity.
4. **Filter and prioritise signals** by coding sources for intent, production mode, discipline, and institutional backing to understand who produces these ideas and with what support.
5. **Assess and amplify signals** using the Ladder, using AI-assisted techniques to extract innovations, then verifying patterns through manual review.
6. **Synthesise transformation** in action at each ladder rung to trace how participation moves from discourse into implementation.
