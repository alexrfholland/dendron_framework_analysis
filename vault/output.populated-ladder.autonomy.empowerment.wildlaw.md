### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### EURIGHTS: Towards an EU Charter of the Fundamental Rights of Nature

- **Organisation**: EESC
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because 'Wild Law' is cited and informs the legal philosophy, but the actionable mechanisms are developed under Earth Jurisprudence and the Rights of Nature Charter rather than a standalone Wild Law program.

- Citation and influence: 

> CULLINAN C. Wild Law. A Manifesto for Earth Justice, Totnes, 2003.
>
> *(Bibliography, Section 8, p. 133)*


- Connection to Earth Jurisprudence and ecological law approach: 

> Just as alternative models of economics are being proposed that are more holistic, it is imperative that law evolves to meet the challenges of our time... a few key pieces of legislation that start to shift the structural frame - such as a Fundamental Charter for the Rights of Nature - are needed.

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### SCTRANSS25: Environment strategy for Scotland – transformative changes for sustainability

- **Organisation**: Scottish Government
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because Wild Law is introduced as part of a family of eco-centric legal frameworks, but the concrete, actionable mechanisms provided in the report are developed under Rights of Nature rather than Wild Law per se.

- Wild Law is described within a set of approaches that reconfigure human-nature legal relations: 

> They are interconnected concepts... shift away from an anthropocentric perspective towards eco-centric ones... the terms Rights of Nature and Wild Law address specific legal recognition and protection of nature’s rights.
>
> *(7.2)*


- The actionable programme (legislation, courts, standing, guardians) is presented in detail under RoN rather than Wild Law as a separate framework. (7.2)

- It nonetheless informs the ethical and legal basis for empowering nonhumans in law, contributing to the conceptual scaffold of the report’s legal proposals. (7.2)
