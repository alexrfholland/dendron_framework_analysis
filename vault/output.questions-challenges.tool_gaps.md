# TOOL_GAPS: Tool gaps

## Sources and Questions

### ICNATUREPOS24: Blueprint for a Nature-Positive Adelaide

**Question**: What technical guidance is needed to overcome implementation barriers and maintenance challenges for biodiverse plantings?

**Evidence**: “Lack of technical guidance available 16%... Maintenance is an obstacle for continuing to achieve biodiversity goals... Develop guidelines and associated training programs for maintenance of biodiverse plantings, using plant palettes adapted from local ecosystems for urban areas...” (Figure 11; Section 6.8)

### EUECOSERVG2021: Ecosystem services accounting – part III

**Question**: What practical tools and workflows are needed to support statistical offices and practitioners in replicating more-than-human accounts over time?

**Evidence**: “Finally, simplifying complexity needs to bring together a variety of disciplines… It is very difficult to collect all the knowledge you need when you need it, especially for statistical offices. For this reason, the availability of plug-in tools that enable practitioners to replicate (tested and validated) modelling procedures could help greatly.” (Chapter 8 Conclusions)
“The creation of geographical information system plug-ins is currently work in progress ..., which may relatively soon generate concrete tools to be used in an open-source environment.” (Chapter 8 Conclusions)

### IPBESMODELS46: Report of the IPBES task force on scenarios and models – Nature Futures Scenarios

**Question**: What modelling tools capture governance, norms, and behaviour that shape nature-relevant decisions and outcomes?

**Evidence**: “Representing values and their relationship to norms was raised as an important challenge in modelling the NFF. Participants signalled that the right set of tools to represent such relationships was not available, as models of institutional behaviour and policy were lacking.” (IV)

### IMFNAT: Embedded in nature: nature-related economic and financial risks and policy considerations

**Question**: Data and scenario limitations impede granular assessment of nature-related risks and supervisory action.

**Evidence**: “Efforts to estimate the impact of nature‑related risks on GDP are still in their early stages and vary considerably... There is growing recognition that estimates of macroeconomic costs are likely conservative... models are skewed toward... provisioning... regulation and maintenance services are less captured.” (Conceptual Framework)
“Scenario analysis should cover key macroeconomic transmission channels... the 'local‑global trade‑off'... reflects the need to reflect both local specificities and the global macro‑financial criticality of nature loss.” (Empirical Analysis/Scenarios guidance)

### EURIGHTS: Towards an EU Charter of the Fundamental Rights of Nature

**Question**: What tools are needed to operationalize resilience and non-regression within EU decision-making for nonhuman empowerment?

**Evidence**: “It is possible to combine Rights of Nature with the rule of resilience within the legislation on environmental impacts... the regulation of a ‘resilience study’ (RS) and an ‘assessment of resilience’ (AoR) could become an important link between Rights of Nature, fundamental human rights and environmental assessments.” (Section 5.6.2, p. 75-77)

### UKHYDRO22: Written evidence (LUE0078) to the Land Use in England Committee inquiry

**Question**: What standards, indicators, and verification systems are needed to assess outcomes of nature-based and biodiversity market policies (BNG, ecosystem markets)?

**Evidence**: “The key challenge is the development of cost-effective and independent means of verifying the outcomes and benefits of these market-driven polices. A further challenge is the current absence of standards and indicators of success or failure, and regulatory frameworks underpinned by robust science.” (Q7 Response)

### UNESCOAI23: Recommendation on the ethics of artificial intelligence

**Question**: What standards and indicators are needed to assess and compare ethics of AI policies and practices across contexts?

**Evidence**: 

> Appropriate tools and indicators should be developed for assessing the effectiveness and efficiency thereof against agreed standards, priorities and targets... The monitoring and assessment... should be carried out continuously in a systematic way proportionate to the relevant risks.
>
> *(V. Monitoring and evaluation)*

### DBIO23: Integrating biodiversity in urban development

**Question**: What new methods are needed to capture cultural values and support rapid assessments for biodiversity-inclusive design?

**Evidence**: “Lähde et al. (2019) state ‘we still lack proper methods’ to understand cultural values attributed to biodiversity while Bryant (2006) emphasised the need for ‘rapid assessments’ to understand the relative ecological importance of a site.” (3.2)

---

### NPOS25: Draft State of Nature Metrics

**Question**: What tooling is missing to support multi-scale granularity, indicator integration, and auditable reporting workflows?

**Evidence**:  

> Renamed and refined metric maturity levels... Clarified use cases and integration with standards... Developing piloting guidelines... Designing for different granularity levels... Auditable...
>
> *(Metric development and roll-out model; Appendix A: Key updates)*
