## Score 4: Actionable Mechanisms

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### ECUADOR09: Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador

- **Organisation**: Republic of Ecuador
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because the Constitution embeds a Mother Earth–centric paradigm (Pacha Mama) as a foundational legal principle, operationalized through enforceable rights of nature, a national vision of Buen Vivir (sumak kawsay), sectoral obligations, and institutional duties, thus providing concrete mechanisms across governance for living in harmony and balance with Mother Earth.

- Context/synthesis: Foundational invocation and celebration of Pacha Mama in the Preamble, framing state purpose and societal goals: “CELEBRATING nature, the Pacha Mama (Mother Earth), of which we are a part and which is vital to our existence… A new form of public coexistence, in diversity and in harmony with nature, to achieve the good way of living, the sumak kawsay.” (Preamble)

- Context/synthesis: Mother Earth (Pacha Mama) as rights-bearing subject, with legal enforceability and restoration duties—showing concrete institutionalization of living-in-balance: “Nature, or Pacha Mama… has the right to integral respect… All persons… can call upon public authorities to enforce the rights of nature… Nature has the right to be restored… preventive and restrictive measures on activities that might lead to the extinction of species…” (Arts. 71–73)

- Context/synthesis: The Good Way of Living (sumak kawsay) system—explicit constitutional architecture aligning planning, policy, and institutions with harmony-with-nature outcomes: “The State shall plan the development of the country… The good way of living shall require… to effectively exercise their rights… The development structure shall have the following objectives:… To restore and conserve nature and maintain a healthy and sustainable environment… (Arts. 275–276); Title VII: THE GOOD WAY OF LIVING SYSTEM”

- Context/synthesis: Integrative obligations and indicators (water, biodiversity, ecosystems, climate) reflecting Mother Earth–centric actions across sectors: “The State shall guarantee the conservation, recovery and integral management of water resources, watersheds and ecological flows… All activities that can affect the quality and amount of water and the equilibrium of ecosystems shall be regulated… The conservation of biodiversity and all of its components are declared to be of public interest…” (Arts. 411, 400)

- Context/synthesis: Preventive, precautionary, and participatory mechanisms ensure Mother Earth’s regeneration, including ex ante consultation and community roles: “All state decision or authorization that could affect the environment shall be consulted with the community… The State shall take into consideration the opinion of the community… the decision whether to implement or not the project shall be adopted by a resolution that is duly substantiated…” (Art. 398)

#### UNBOL2023: Plurinational State of Bolivia position on Nature-Based Solutions – UNEP Consultation

- **Organisation**: UNEP
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because ‘Mother Earth Centric Actions’ are the core of the document, with a firm, actionable policy package that includes concrete legal steps, governance principles, educational programs, redistribution mechanisms, and institutional reforms aimed at more-than-human empowerment.

- Context/synthesis: The document defines and positions Mother Earth Centric Actions as the alternative governance paradigm to NbS, explicitly endorsed under CBD COP15 Target 19(f): 

> Bolivia wants to highlight the existence of visions and alternatives to the NBS, such as the ‘Mother Earth Centric Actions’. This proposal has been accepted in the decision 19(f) of the 2022 Kunming Montreal global framework...
>
> *(p.2)*


- Context/synthesis: It provides a clear, operational definition grounded in an ecocentric and rights-based approach and spells out implications (non-commodification, harmonious relations): 

> ‘Ecocentric approach and based on rights that allows actions aimed at harmonious and complementary relationships between peoples and nature, and that promotes the continuity of all living beings and their communities and ensures the non-commodification of the environmental functions of Mother Earth’.
>
> *(Annex)*


- Context/synthesis: The Annex lists concrete actionable mechanisms (legal recognition, policy instruments, epistemological parity, redistribution, pedagogy, nonhuman respect, local governance, non-market mitigation/adaptation, sustainable consumption within limits). Example: 

> a) Recognize Mother Earth as a living being and subject of rights... b) Develop policy instruments to protect, manage and restore nature without commercializing its environmental functions... d) Facilitate epistemological parity between modern science and ancestral science... e) Promote economic growth along with wealth redistribution mechanisms... f) Develop pedagogical and educational processes related to the Living Well... j) Implement joint mitigation and adaptation actions... contemplating equity... and non-market approaches...
>
> *(Annex)*


- Context/synthesis: It sets negotiation goals and criteria for success (plural approaches, non-commodification, equity, CBDR, non-market approaches) and requests a new UNEA resolution: 

> the purpose of the consultation... is to review, complement and work on a new and additional Resolution that incorporates plural approaches... Alternatives to the NBS... such as the 'Mother Earth Centric Actions'...
>
> *(p.2–3)*

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### UNLEGAL: Environmental rule of law: tracking progress and charting future directions

- **Organisation**: UNEP
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the report discusses and cites the Bolivian ‘Law of the Rights of Mother Earth’ and related ‘Mother Earth’ framing, linking it to ecocentric rights of nature, but does not develop detailed policy mechanisms within this report.

- Explicit recognition of ‘Mother Earth’ legal framework and its scope: 

> The Bolivian Law of the Rights of Mother Earth recognizes rights of Mother Earth and all of her constituents, including human communities, as a collective public interest.
>
> *(Chapter 4, Section 4.3.5)*


- Placement within a broader family of rights-of-nature frameworks and constitutional recognition (contextual comparison and implications): 

> Some recognition encompasses all of nature. For example, the Constitution of Ecuador states, ‘Nature, or Pacha Mama, where life is reproduced and occurs, has the right to integral respect for its existence and for the maintenance and regeneration of its life cycles, structure, functions and evolutionary processes’.
>
> *(Chapter 4, Section 4.3.5)*


- Ethical and political implications are discussed conceptually (but not operationalized here): 

> This view starts from the idea that some non-human entities have moral status independent from their benefits to humanity... Proponents of this view believe that... is a requirement for the environmental rule of law.
>
> *(Chapter 4, Section 4.3.5)*

#### EUHRPLAN21: Human rights for the planet

- **Organisation**: Council of Europe
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because Mother Earth frameworks are explicitly presented (Bolivia, Ecuador) as comparative examples and linked to legal personhood trends; however, they are not adopted or operationalized in European governance in this source.

- Explicit reference to constitutional Mother Earth rights: 

> Constitutions of Bolivia and Ecuador that create a new political and legal subject: nature – Pachamama -Mother Earth, see Constitución Política del Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia 2009... and Constitución de Ecuador 2008...
>
> *(Overview of ECtHR environmental case-law)*


- Calderón situates Mother Earth within a continental shift: 

> This ecocentric tendency toward the protection of the environment has spread throughout the Americas, not only in its recognition of the right to a healthy environment, but also in its recognition of the rights of nature and the emerging concept of Earth Jurisprudence.
>
> *(Inter-American approaches)*

#### EUNATURERIGHTS21: Can nature get it right? Rights of Nature in the European context

- **Organisation**: European Parliament
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the study provides a detailed, contextual account of Pachamama/Madre Tierra constitutional models and legislative instruments, using them to inform the critique and to identify transferable ideas; it does not propose adopting Mother Earth frameworks within the EU.

- Detailed treatment of Mother Earth constitutional provisions: 

> The year after, Bolivia adopted a new Constitution... the Law on the Rights of Mother Earth (Madre Tierra)... Article 7, seven rights of Mother Earth are recognised, the right: to life... to the diversity of life... to water... to clean air... to equilibrium... to restoration... to pollution-free living...
>
> *(2.4 Rights of Nature at a constitutional level)*


- Analytical comparison with NZ guardian models and EU context: 

> The legislation in Aotearoa New Zealand under the agreement between the Crown and the Maori tribes... was part of a mediation and reconciliation process... The chosen solution can therefore be characterised as having transferred the title to the river from the Crown to the 'river itself'.
>
> *(2.4 Rights of Nature at a constitutional level)*

#### TNBEYOND24: Analysing the beyond growth debate

- **Organisation**: TNO Publiek
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the review explains Mother Earth rights within Latin American legal frameworks and analyses implications for governance, but as part of a literature-based appraisal.

- The review presents Mother Earth rights as part of RoN implementation: 

> Buen vivir... includes enshrining the rights of nature... rights of Mother Earth... including the right to life, diversity, water, clean air, equilibrium, restoration and pollution-free living.
>
> *(A.7.2; Text box A7)*


- It discusses consequences and contradictions in practice (e.g., extractivism), underscoring implementation challenges. (Text box A7)

#### IPBESPATHWAYS19: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 5. Realizing a sustainable world for nature and people: transformative strategies, actions and roles for all

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the ‘Rights of Mother Earth’ is explicitly cited (Bolivia’s Universal Declaration), illustrating cultural-legal shifts and narratives that recognize Earth’s rights, but the chapter does not provide a detailed, formal mechanism under this banner beyond examples and narrative shifts.

- Explicit reference to Mother Earth rights as cultural-legal narrative: 

> Adoption of the Universal Declaration for the Rights of Mother Earth (2010) by Bolivia and other entities around the world contributes to a shift in cultural narratives and norms about the links between human and nature’s well-being.
>
> *(5.7.2)*


- The chapter also references Ecuador’s ‘Pachamama’ constitutional rights as an example of rights-based recognition (Table 5.1), reinforcing the Mother Earth-centric approach.

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### EURIGHTS: Towards an EU Charter of the Fundamental Rights of Nature

- **Organisation**: EESC
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the study references and engages with 'Mother Earth' declarations and programs (UN and Bolivia) to inform the Charter’s legal philosophy, but it does not propose the adoption of a specific ME-centred policy instrument within the EU.

- Reference to ME declarations and influence: 

> In the context of international law, two documents must be considered: a) the UN 'World Charter for Nature' of 1982; b) the 'Universal Declaration of the Rights of Mother Earth' of 2010... it inspired the UN 'Harmony with Nature' program and this program promotes the dissemination of the opinio iuris on the Rights of Nature.
>
> *(Section 2.1.1, p. 18)*


- Regional legal precedents (Bolivia and Ecuador) substantively discussed: 

> Bolivia is the only State that has implemented a comprehensive legislation on the rights of Mother Earth.
>
> *(Section 7.2.1, p. 123-124)*

## Score 1: Token Acknowledgement

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### IPBESTCA2: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 2. Visions of a sustainable world – for nature and people

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because Mother Earth/Pachamama is referenced through example visions and document titles, but not developed as a detailed policy framework within this chapter.

- The curated vision list includes Pachamama as a movement/initiative: 

> Social Movements... • Pachamama* * Is also a government initiative.
>
> *(Table 2.3)*


- The NFF reference includes Mother Earth in its scope, signposting alignment with Mother Earth-centric framings: 

> The Nature Futures Framework, a flexible tool to support the development of scenarios and models of desirable futures for people, nature and Mother Earth...
>
> *(Reference to IPBES 2023b in 2.3.2.2)*


- Prevents higher score: no concrete Mother Earth-centric legal/policy mechanisms are detailed in this chapter.

#### IPBSVALUES22: Summary for policymakers of the methodological assessment of the diverse values and valuation of nature

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because ‘Mother Earth’ is referenced briefly (e.g., cosmocentric world-views and rights of Mother Earth) but not developed as a full framework with operational detail in the SPM. - “Cosmocentric world-views can be understood as bridging bio/ecocentric and pluricentric world-views. They refer to living in harmony with all forms of existence... as those that belong to indigenous peoples and local communities.” (Box SPM 1) - “Different rights-based approaches... rights of Mother Earth...” (D2)

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### SCTRANSS25: Environment strategy for Scotland – transformative changes for sustainability

- **Organisation**: Scottish Government
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because the report references Mother Earth rights mainly as international examples (Bolivia, Ecuador) in the context of Rights of Nature, without developing a Scotland-specific Mother Earth policy.

- It cites Mother Earth rights within RoN case examples: 

> Bolivia has also incorporated RoN into its constitution, with the law recognising 11 rights of Mother Earth, including the right to life, diversity, water, clean air, equilibrium, restoration and pollution-free living.
>
> *(Box 7: Examples of Rights of Nature)*


- The report’s actionable agenda for Scotland is articulated under RoN broadly rather than this specific framework. (7.2)
