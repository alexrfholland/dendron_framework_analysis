# More-than-human deliberative democracy approaches

## Score 4: Actionable Mechanisms

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### SCTRANSS25: Environment strategy for Scotland – transformative changes for sustainability

- **Organisation**: Scottish Government
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because the report provides concrete, actionable proposals to institutionalise more-than-human deliberation (micro-democracy with nonhuman representation, arts-enabled voice), clarifies goals (coexistence, care), and links to broader governance and policy design.

- It proposes expansion of deliberative mini-publics to include nonhuman representation: 

> Micro-democracy initiatives on a wider range of issues e.g. climate change, food sustainability, nature futures... Represent non-human interests in participatory decision-making processes.
>
> *(Table 3: Political instruments)*


- It recommends creating political positions for future generations and nonhuman nature, specifying outcomes and institutional location: 

> Create sustainable future political position(s) that represents future generations, including non-human nature and more than human worlds.
>
> *(Table 3: Radical and speculative future-making)*


- It illustrates practical public forums (e.g., Embassy of the North Sea) to enact multispecies deliberation and representation: 

> Developing a public space in which humans can communicate with non-humans on an equal basis, the aim is to create new politics of representation.
>
> *(7.3 – Box 8)*


- It links deliberation to knowledge production (arts, humanities, decolonised research) and to evaluation criteria (nonhuman wellbeing, ethics of care), demonstrating an integrated design with clear implications: 

> Mobilise relationality insights in research and action research... Embed considerations of the environment and non-human across different areas of education... Promote assessment of wellbeing (human, non-human)...
>
> *(Table 3)*

### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### UNESCOEDU20: Learning to become with the world: education for future survival

- **Organisation**: Common Worlds/UNESCO
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Humanities/Ethics

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the document conceptually expands deliberation via cosmopolitics to include nonhuman worlds and proposes hypothetical institutional shifts (e.g., renaming the UN to ‘Naturescultures’), but does not present concrete more-than-human deliberative bodies or procedures. - Cosmopolitics is proposed as an alternative to human-only cosmopolitanism, expanding deliberative membership beyond humans: 

> Educators now fully embrace the principles of cosmopolitics... a broader definition of what it means ‘to belong’ – one that embraces everyone and everything both living and nonliving – and therefore encompasses more-than-human worlds.
>
> *(Visionary declarations, 6)*

 - It imagines institutional change to signal inclusion in deliberative fora: 

> Following intense deliberations, it was unanimously decided to replace ‘Nations’ with the ‘Naturescultures’ in the name of the UN, signaling a full embrace of the principles of cosmopolitics as a practice – and an art – of living and dying as well as is possible together on a damaged planet.
>
> *(Visionary declarations, 6)*
