## Score 4: Actionable Mechanisms

### IMPLEMENTATION AND METRICS

#### IUCNWILD16: Wilderness protected areas: management guidelines for IUCN Category 1b protected areas

- **Organisation**: IUCN
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Applied/Practice-Based

**Evidence:**

This scores 4 because wilderness stewardship is the document’s core guiding framework and is operationalized with concrete, actionable mechanisms (e.g., indicator-based planning, Minimum Requirements Decision Guide, monitoring protocols, governance models) that managers can implement in practice to protect and empower nonhuman nature over time. - The guidelines position stewardship as the central managerial ethic, with explicit duties, tools, and protocols to sustain nonhuman values: 

> Thank you for your interest in and commitment to wilderness stewardship through designation and protection. The IUCN protected area management category of wilderness allows us to understand nature on its own terms and maintain those terms while allowing (and even encouraging) humans to experience wild nature.
>
> *(Foreword)*

 - The report details stepwise, actionable stewardship methods (planning, indicators, thresholds, monitoring) to protect wilderness on nonhumans’ terms: 

> Management should determine the limits of acceptable change in wilderness conditions by setting standards through indicator-based planning systems to protect the area and uphold wilderness values.
>
> *(2.7)*

 - The MRDG provides a concrete decision procedure to minimize human intrusions in favor of wilderness character: 

> A systematic decision process for determining appropriateness of administrative actions in wilderness is important and necessary... The Minimum Requirements Decision Guide (MRDG) developed by the Arthur Carhart Wilderness Training Center... suggests a simple principle: ‘use the minimum tool’.
>
> *(2.9; Case study 8)*

 - Stewardship is operationalized across governance and practice with measurable outcomes and indicators: 

> Wilderness decision makers must evaluate the ability of a wilderness protected area to conserve the site’s wilderness attributes and values... Using best-practices tools and robust monitoring frameworks.
>
> *(5.1)*

 - The framework translates into explicit outcomes, negotiation strategies, and success criteria (e.g., non-degradation, carrying capacities, buffer zones) that align with empowering nonhuman communities: 

> Wilderness sites... should be managed to maintain the highest integrity of all components of ecosystems, wildlife... through an explicit focus on non-degradation.
>
> *(2.2)*

; 

> Buffer zones act... to protect wilderness areas from external forces and incompatible development.
>
> *(2.11)*

## Score 3: Core Conceptual Device / Implications Explored

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### UNPLANETBOUND22: Thematic study: planetary boundaries

- **Organisation**: UNDRR
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because planetary stewardship is advanced as a central guiding ethos for reorganizing governance, finance, and economics to protect nonhuman worlds, with explicit implications for decision-making, though concrete procedural designs are high-level rather than fully specified. - It names stewardship as a core normative anchor: 

> Start to think differently about human relationships with the greater Earth community, moving away from our purely extractive relationship with nature, towards an ethos of planetary stewardship to ensure collective, planetary well-being and health.
>
> *(Part 1.5, final bullets)*

 - It connects stewardship to governance and finance outcomes: 

> Support the disaster risk community with deepened understanding of... how this values shift... towards the ethos of planetary stewardship can ensure greater planetary well-being; [and] how transformative changes are needed in our governance, finance and economic systems to promote the ethos of stewardship and to reflect nature’s true value.
>
> *(Part 2.3.2, Priority for Action 2, Message 2.3)*

 - It grounds stewardship in more-than-human agency: 

> In the Anthropocene... we now have an even stronger stewardship responsibility to enhance biosphere resilience and to ‘work towards stabilizing the Earth system and its biosphere in a state that, hopefully, is safe for humanity to operate within’... Equally, the relevance of restoring our relationship with nature for the goals of disaster risk reduction is clear.
>
> *(Part 1.3, Resilience and stewardship responsibility)*

#### IPBSVALUES22: Summary for policymakers of the methodological assessment of the diverse values and valuation of nature

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because stewardship (including ‘Earth stewardship’) is treated as a foundational value and as one of the explicit sustainability pathways, with detailed implications for instruments, capacities, and outcomes across the assessment; however, it is not codified as a single operational standard. - Earth stewardship is one of the principal pathways linked to biodiversity protection and values shifts: “The ‘Earth stewardship’ pathway emphasizes local sovereignty and agrarian reform, solidarity, and the promotion of biocultural practices.” (Box SPM 3) - The assessment defines broad values (e.g., responsibility, stewardship) necessary to realign societal goals and instruments: “Societal goals will need to align more strongly with broad values like justice, stewardship, unity and responsibility...” (KM8) - It translates stewardship into governance/policy levers (values-centred guidelines, capacities, rights-based approaches): “Decision-making... can be advanced by following six interrelated values-centred guidelines...” (D1); “Recognizing and respecting the world-views, values and traditional knowledge of indigenous peoples and local communities...” (KM7) - Stewardship is connected to outcomes and criteria of success via scenarios and valuation (intrinsic/relational values integrated): “The types of scenarios... consider a range of instrumental, relational and intrinsic values...” (C7)

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### UNESCOAI23: Recommendation on the ethics of artificial intelligence

- **Organisation**: UNESCO
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 3 because the Recommendation operationalizes stewardship through 'Ethical governance and stewardship' with multiple concrete directives (impact assessments, oversight, enforcement, certification, monitoring) that include environmental and ecosystem considerations, yet it is framed within AI governance rather than a separate planetary stewardship state. - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> POLICY AREA 2: ETHICAL GOVERNANCE AND STEWARDSHIP... Member States should ensure that AI governance mechanisms are inclusive, transparent, multidisciplinary, multilateral... include aspects of anticipation, and effective protection, monitoring of impact, enforcement and redress.
>
> *(Policy Area 2)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Member States should ensure that harms caused through AI systems are investigated and redressed... promote auditability and traceability... develop international standards that describe measurable, testable levels of safety and transparency...
>
> *(Policy Area 2)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Member States should foster the development of... a digital ecosystem for ethical and inclusive development of AI systems... and establish mechanisms... to ensure the active participation of all Member States, especially LMICs, in international discussions concerning AI governance.
>
> *(Policy Area 2)*

## Score 2: Theoretical Treatment

### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### UNGEOETHICS22: Concept note of the World Commission on the Ethics of Scientific Knowledge and Technology (COMEST) on the ethics of climate engineering

- **Organisation**: UNESCO COMEST
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because stewardship is discussed as one among intercultural ethical perspectives (Christian perspectives on stewardship and responsible governance), but it is not developed into concrete stewardship mechanisms for nonhuman empowerment. - It includes stewardship as a viewpoint to be integrated in intercultural ethics: 

> the care dimension: Christian perspectives on stewardship and the need for responsible governance.
>
> *(III. Intercultural ethical perspectives)*

 - It positions these perspectives within a plural ethical analysis alongside Ubuntu duties to ancestors/future generations and Indigenous responsibilities towards nature. (III. Intercultural ethical perspectives)

### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE REVIEWS

#### UNLAND17_2: The Global Land Outlook: Part 2 - The Outlook

- **Organisation**: UNCCD
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because stewardship is explicitly invoked (including as a literature reference and as a normative stance for farmers), but it functions as a motivating ethic and descriptive label rather than a structured management framework with concrete governance mechanisms or indicators.

- The report explicitly frames the agricultural challenge as one of restoring stewardship: 

> Unsustainable agriculture and land use: restoring stewardship for biospheric integrity.
>
> *(Chapter 7, citing DeWitt, 2009, in the section '1. Poor management practices')*


- It uses the stewardship lens to assign roles/responsibilities, yet not as a formalized plan: 

> Most farmers are deeply committed to the long-term health and productivity of their land. The fact that many are caught in an unsustainable management spiral is a cause of deep distress.
>
> *(Chapter 7, Conclusion)*


- In the drylands synthesis, stewardship is attached to concrete agents (farmers) and a key mitigation/adaptation task (soil carbon), still without a codified stewardship model: 

> Farmers, as stewards of soil carbon, are at the heart of the effort to address the biggest environmental challenges of our time: biodiversity loss, climate change, and land degradation.
>
> *(Chapter 12, Conclusion)*

#### UNLAND17_1: The Global Land Outlook: Part 1 - The Big Picture

- **Organisation**: UNCCD
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because stewardship is explicitly discussed as a guiding ethos for land managers and across faith traditions, with multiple references to long-term care, but remains conceptual and human-led without concrete institutional mechanisms empowering nonhuman agency.

- Stewardship is framed as an expanded role for land managers beyond production, highlighting multi-species benefits: 

> A more comprehensive understanding of land’s multiple functions and services (i.e., the benefits to humans and other species) and the process of ascribing value to them suggests that in the future farmers and other land managers should have an expanded role as stewards of the land and its associated resources.
>
> *(Chapter 1, Meaning of Land, p. 21)*


- The report articulates stewardship as a long-term duty tied to rights and responsibilities: 

> It is clear that the next few decades will be the most critical in shaping and implementing a new and transformative global land agenda. In much of the developing world, achieving more secure rights in terms of tenure, gender equity, and social justice, will be an essential step to improving the long-term stewardship of land resources.
>
> *(Executive Summary, p. 13)*


- Ethical grounding of stewardship is reiterated across religions: 

> This view is now shared by the large majority of the world’s major philosophies and and religions, which recognize the duty of stewardship.
>
> *(Chapter 1, Meaning of Land, p. 25)*


- While stewardship informs goals and values (e.g., rights–rewards–responsibility triad), it is not operationalized into specific governance designs that would grant nonhuman co-decision power.

#### IPBESTCA2: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 2. Visions of a sustainable world – for nature and people

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because stewardship is explicitly included as a component of visions (e.g., nature stewardship) and as a behavioural/ethical thread, but is not elaborated into a specific management framework with steps.

- Stewardship appears within the value–pathway mapping between relational and instrumental values, giving it a role in practice framing: 

> This cluster is one of the most populated... sits between the ‘nature for society’ and ‘nature as culture’ corners. Here, there is an emphasis on social-ecological restoration, nature stewardship and strong nature-society connections.
>
> *(Table 2.2)*


- Spiritual and ethical framings call for stewardship behaviourally: 

> Theme 4. Spiritual reconnection for behavioural change: ... Multiple visions refer to faith-based initiatives and the role of spirituality in fostering environmental stewardship and transformative change in human behaviour.
>
> *(Figure 2.4 caption)*


- Prevents higher score: no specific stewardship governance tools are developed in this chapter.

#### EUSTI50: S&T&I for 2050: science, technology and innovation for ecosystem performance – accelerating sustainability transitions

- **Organisation**: EC DG R&I
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because stewardship is a cross-cutting orientation (e.g., 'ecosystem performance', 'strong role for science as mediator') and used to frame responsibilities, but without specific institutional empowerment of nonhumans beyond rights/legal personhood discussed elsewhere.

- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> This section describes one of the main outputs, a conceptualisation of ecosystem performance and thus new conceptual/theoretical framework for understanding human/nature relationship... Three perspectives... concerned with the establishment of caring relationships in new collectives with humans and other entities on an equal level.
>
> *(2 THREE PERSPECTIVES)*


- Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> RTI opportunities [Immersing & Caring]... Strong role for science as mediator for other voices... RTI challenges Include other types of knowledge (embodied, indigenous), overcome reservations towards including non-humans on equal terms...
>
> *(2.3 Table 3)*

#### EUONEHEALTH24: One Health governance in the European Union

- **Organisation**: SAPEA
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because stewardship is explicitly listed as a core principle of OHHLEP and linked to responsibilities toward animal welfare and ecosystem integrity and intergenerational wellbeing, but the report does not set dedicated stewardship institutions beyond its integration within One Health actions.

- Stewardship is a declared principle with ethical and governance implications, expanding responsibilities beyond humans: 

> stewardship and the responsibility of humans to change behaviour and adopt sustainable solutions that recognise the importance of animal welfare and the integrity of the whole ecosystem, thus securing the wellbeing of current and future generations
>
> *(One Health definition – Issues to consider; OHHLEP Key Underlying Principles)*


- It links stewardship to practical actions (behaviour change, sustainable solutions), animal welfare, and ecosystem integrity, shaping goals and outcomes in the operational checklist and indicators (e.g., animal welfare as pandemic prevention factor): 

> Of critical importance too is the level of animal welfare and protection, which is highly relevant for pandemic prevention.
>
> *(Chapter 3 – Why do we need indicators?)*

#### UNTRANS25: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 1. Transformative change and a sustainable world

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because stewardship is treated as a guiding value within the framework, but not as an operational management or policy framework directed to nonhuman empowerment. - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Starting with views can include... adopting and prioritizing broad sustainability-aligned values such as care and stewardship (IPBES, 2022a), fostering views that are reflexive and critical to the underlying causes...
>
> *(Section 1.3.1, Views)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> [Respectful and reciprocal relationships] emphasize... moving away from instrumentalized relationships... towards fostering values of care, respect, solidarity, responsibility and stewardship.
>
> *(Section 1.3.2)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Acknowledging humanity’s dependence on nature can be expressed in attitudes of gratitude for the gifts of Mother Earth and a willingness to give back (Kimmerer, 2013...); e.g., through processes and actions for restoration, reparation and regeneration.
>
> *(Section 1.3.2)*

#### IPBESPATHWAYS19: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 5. Realizing a sustainable world for nature and people: transformative strategies, actions and roles for all

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because stewardship is repeatedly used to frame actor roles (especially IPLCs) and governance outcomes, but remains a human stewardship orientation rather than an explicit more-than-human empowerment framework.

- The chapter highlights custodianship and stewardship as levers: 

> Advancing inclusive place-based conservation where people already sustainably steward lands and waters is a key lever for transformative change... protecting Indigenous Peoples and local communities’ self-determination... and biocultural governance systems.
>
> *(Exec. summary, point 2)*


- It emphasizes stewardship in decision-making: 

> Inclusion of such values also counters the vested interests of producers... The creation of governance structures that... incorporate the plurality of views related to nature, knowledge systems and voices provide a powerful lever for strengthening equity and a perceived responsibility.
>
> *(Exec. summary, point 8)*

#### IBPESWILD22: Chapter 2: Conceptualizing the sustainable use of wild species

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because the chapter explicitly uses the language of stewardship to describe Indigenous and local practices caring for wild species and ecosystems, discussing its role conceptually and empirically, but it does not provide a distinct stewardship governance mechanism to empower nonhumans directly. 

- The chapter links stewardship with sustainable use among IPLC: 

> Customs and norms are critical components of indigenous peoples and local communities’ conceptualizations of sustainable use and serve a key role in the stewardship, management, and care for wild species
>
> *(Executive Summary, point 5)*

.

- It details the stewardship ethos and practice as part of local norms: 

> Sustainable use practices are often guided or informed by intricate and nuanced combinations of spiritual customs and ceremonial practices, regulations, sanctions, and taboos, respect for wild species as kin, sharing across social networks, and maintaining and transmitting indigenous and local knowledge
>
> *(Executive Summary, point 5)*

.

- In the IPLC section, care and stewardship are described across world regions (e.g., Andean, Amazon, Australia), framing ongoing human responsibilities: 

> Wild harvest values are nested in the 'biophysical, human and supernatural worlds'... where plants, animals, ancestral beings and humans are part of the interconnected web of relationships
>
> *(2.2.4, Perspectives from indigenous/aboriginal Australia)*

### POLICY, LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

#### NZOCEAN21: The breaking wave: reforming the oceans management system in Aotearoa New Zealand

- **Organisation**: Environmental Defence Society
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Social Science/Policy

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because stewardship (including kaitiakitanga/guardianship) is discussed as an ethic guiding responsibilities and tools (e.g., rāhui, guardianships), but is not operationalised as a standalone, detailed governance mechanism in this report. 

- Stewardship ethic as normative guide: 

> Kaitiakitanga encompasses all those things. ... Kaitiakitanga (caretaking/guardianship) are bound up in te ao Māori.
>
> *(Chapter 4.2; also Chapter 2.4)*


- Guardianship reflected in institutions: 

> There are many forms that co-governance could take... groups like the Guardians of Fiordland and the Kaikōura Marine Guardians... create a direct conduit of anecdotal and social information to the Ministers of Fisheries and Conservation.
>
> *(Chapter 8.4; Chapter 7 Co-governance spotlight)*


- Stewardship orientation of the system: 

> The system is a tool for building our relationship with te moana, not just to reign in the more destructive tendencies of humanity.
>
> *(Chapter 3.5)*

### ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS

#### ICNATUREPOS24: Blueprint for a Nature-Positive Adelaide

- **Organisation**: Interdisciplinary Conservation Science Group
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because stewardship is discussed as a guiding ethic within BSUD (facilitating local stewardship of biodiversity through 'cues to care') and as a practical engagement goal, but it is not developed as a standalone, formal stewardship framework with institutional mechanisms.

- The fifth BSUD principle makes stewardship explicit in design practice, linking it to empowerment and conflict resolution: 

> Cities are human environments and public engagement is key to successful conservation. Urban design can help facilitate local stewardship of biodiversity by providing 'cues to care' (Nassauer 1995), creating opportunities for positive interactions with nature, and addressing conflicts between biodiversity and safety objectives.
>
> *(Section 4.1.1 Five BSUD principles)*


- The blueprint emphasizes using demonstration sites to build acceptance and stewardship behaviors: 

> Demonstration sites can ameliorate resistance to change... Sites like the Glenelg Wastewater Treatment Plant show the successful implementation of native plants... and can inspire residents to consider using locally native species in their own gardens.
>
> *(Section 6.6)*


- It highlights volunteer stewardship's importance and vulnerability, discussing supports needed to sustain it: 

> Many of the case study projects are supported or driven by volunteers... However, there can be challenges associated with managing volunteers, and a reliance on volunteers can also make projects vulnerable... Ensure sufficient funding and support is available in order to maximise the benefit that can be provided by volunteers.
>
> *(Section 6.3)*

#### SCTRANSS25: Environment strategy for Scotland – transformative changes for sustainability

- **Organisation**: Scottish Government
- **Production Mode**: Single-Expert-Author
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 2 because stewardship is discussed contextually (e.g., co-management, Indigenous stewardship) as part of the broader legal and rights-based pathways, but without a dedicated stewardship programme with instruments in this report.

- The report cites co-management and stewardship by Indigenous Peoples and local communities and notes their effectiveness: 

> Co-management and stewardship by Indigenous Peoples and local communities can be highly successful... Indigenous Peoples have an especially key role to play...
>
> *(7.4 Rights based and customary instruments)*


- Stewardship is integrated within calls for rights recognition and customary governance, rather than as a separate plan with instruments: 

> Support local communities to gain greater access to and ownership of land... Especially support for Indigenous community customary governance...
>
> *(Table 3: Legal support for community land ownership & access)*

## Score 1: Token Acknowledgement

### ETHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

#### COMESTWATER22: Report of COMEST on water ethics: ocean, freshwater and coastal areas

- **Organisation**: UNESCO COMEST
- **Production Mode**: Large-Team-With-Workshops/Delphi
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because stewardship is explicitly referenced as a principle from cited water ethics frameworks, but it is only mentioned among lists and not developed as a central or operational framework in this report. 

- The report lists stewardship in surveyed ethics: 

> Jennings et al. (2009) identified the following principles of Water Management Ethics: Equal respect for human dignity, Equity and proportionality, Solidarity, The common good, Right relationship or responsible stewardship, Inclusive and deliberative participation.
>
> *(V.2 Ethical Frameworks for Water)*


- It is not further elaborated beyond inclusion in external lists, and does not underpin the report’s main recommendations.

#### IPBESTCA4: IPBES Transformative Change Assessment: Chapter 4. Overcoming the challenges of achieving transformative change

- **Organisation**: IPBES
- **Production Mode**: Large-Expert-Synthesis
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because stewardship is mentioned descriptively in a case (Chipko movement) but not framed as a formal stewardship framework guiding analysis or policy design. - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> The Chipko movement  was a non-violent  uprising  wherein  villagers,  especially  women,  became  active  stewards  of the forests  that they were  dependent  upon.  They  stood  up against  commercial  timber  contractors and hugged the trees to prevent  them from  being  felled... and finally led to the implementation  of the Forest  Conservation  Act, 1980.
>
> *(Figure 4.10, case text)*

 - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: 

> Actions that empower new views, structures and practices can bring to light ideas for transformative change.

 Stewardship is implied as practice, but not elaborated as a formal management framework (4.3)

- **Organisation**: ISC/ISUH/IAP
- **Production Mode**: Small-Expert-Team
- **Author Disciplines**: Interdisciplinary

**Evidence:**

This scores 1 because stewardship is only referenced in passing as a value orientation ('stewards of the earth') without development as a framework or concrete stewardship mechanisms. - Context/synthesis followed by supporting quote: The plan notes that cascading effects undermine our attempts at stewardship, but does not articulate a stewardship governance model: 

> The Anthropocene fundamentally changes societal values, which are the bedrock of economics. Ideas of progress and wealth are being re-thought... and there is a sense of urgency as we are being told that we are approaching tipping points and carrying capacities and that cascading effects undermine our attempts to be stewards of the earth.
